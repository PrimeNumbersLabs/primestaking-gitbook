# How to Buy $XDC?

## <mark style="color:purple;">Steps to Acquire XDC for the Prime Numbers Ecosystem</mark>

To participate in the Prime Numbers ecosystem, you'll need XDC, the native token of the XDC Network. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to purchase XDC:

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 1 — Choose Your Exchange</mark>

XDC is available on both decentralised exchanges (DEXs) and centralised exchanges (CEXs). For beginners, using a CEX is recommended for ease of use. You can find a list of exchanges offering XDC by searching for XDC on platforms like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap. Click on the Exchanges tab to see a list of CEXs where XDC is available.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 2 — Sign Up and Fund Your Account</mark>

If you're already signed up on an exchange that offers XDC, simply deposit funds into your account. If not, create an account on one of the recommended exchanges, complete any necessary verification steps, and transfer funds to the exchange.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 3 — Purchase XDC</mark>

Once your account is funded, search for XDC on the exchange and choose your trading pair (e.g., XDC/USDT). You can either place a Limit Order to buy XDC at a specific price or use the Market Buy option to purchase XDC at the current market price.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 4 — Transfer XDC to Your Wallet</mark>

After purchasing XDC, transfer it to your wallet. Make sure to use the XDC Network when transferring. Remember to adjust your MetaMask address to start with "xdc" instead of "0x" to ensure the transaction is successful.
