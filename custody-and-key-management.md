# Custody & Key Management

PrimeStaking entrusts validator-node keys and staked XDC to **Crypto.com Custody**, a regulated third-party custodian that delivers institutional-grade security while preserving the protocol's non-custodial user experience.

## Overview

| Objective | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Protect validator keys and user funds | Cold-wallet storage in segregated custody accounts |
| Eliminate single-operator risk | Multi-signatory transaction policies and role-based access |
| Maintain on-chain liveness | 24/7 key availability with hardware security modules |
| Provide verifiable solvency | Periodic proof-of-reserves attestations |

---

## Migration Timeline

1. **Key transfer** — Validator keys encrypted and deposited into cold storage. *(Complete)*
2. **Wallet cut-over** — All staking flows rerouted; no user action required. *(Complete)*
3. **Attestation** — Independent auditor to publish proof-of-reserves for custody wallets.

## Impact on Users

- **No change** to reward rates, lock-up periods, or fee structure.
- Users retain **full legal ownership** of their XDC — assets cannot be re-hypothecated.
- The protocol's decentralization roadmap remains intact. Custody secures keys, not consensus.
