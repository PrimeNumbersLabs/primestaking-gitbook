# How to Buy a PRFI NFT

PRFI Staking NFTs are available on **[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/primenumbers-prfi-onft)** on the **Base** network.

---

## Step 1 - Set Up Your Wallet

Ensure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is configured for the **Base** network. If not already set up, add Base as a custom network in your wallet settings:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Network name | Base |
| RPC URL | `https://mainnet.base.org` |
| Chain ID | 8453 |
| Currency | ETH |
| Block explorer | `https://basescan.org` |

## Step 2 - Fund Your Wallet

You need ETH on Base to cover the NFT price and gas fees. Bridge ETH from Ethereum mainnet to Base using the [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org) or a supported exchange.

## Step 3 - Browse the Collection

Go to the [PRFI NFT collection on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/primenumbers-prfi-onft). Review each NFT's rarity, staking potential, and current price.

## Step 4 - Purchase

Connect your wallet to OpenSea, select the NFT you want, click **Buy**, and confirm the transaction. After confirmation, the NFT appears in your wallet and on the PrimeStaking app.
