# XDC Masternode Vaults

## XDC Masternode Vaults: High-Value Staking at 7.65% APY

**XDC Masternode Vaults** are designed for users holding **10M XDC** or more who wish to operate an XDC masternode. These Vaults streamline masternode operations, reward management, and hosting expenses—while offering **liquidity** through **$pstXDC** tokens.

***

### What Are XDC Masternode Vaults?

* **Specialized Staking:** Exclusively for users with **10M XDC**, making it easy to run and maintain a **masternode**.
* **Higher Rewards:** Earn **7.65% APY** from masternode rewards.
* **Liquid Staking Derivative:** When staking 10M XDC, you receive **10M $pstXDC**, which can be used in DeFi without losing your masternode rewards.

***

### How It Works

1. **Mint an XDC Masternode Vault**
   * Users with **10M XDC** can create a masternode vault, represented as an **NFT** that manages the staked tokens.
2. **Receive Liquid Staking Tokens**
   * Once you stake **10M XDC**, the system automatically issues **10M $pstXDC** to your wallet.
   * **$pstXDC** proves your staked tokens and remains fully usable in the ecosystem (e.g., DeFi protocols), without affecting your masternode earnings.
3. **Earn Masternode Rewards**
   * Your staked XDC generates rewards at **7.65% APY**.
   * The platform takes **0.35%** (from the total 8% APY) to cover hosting and operational fees.
   * Rewards are credited proportionally to your masternode vault balance.
4. **Maintain Liquidity Through $pstXDC**
   * **$pstXDC** maintains a **1:1 ratio** with your staked XDC, so you can trade or stake it elsewhere while still collecting masternode rewards.
   * If you ever wish to redeem your XDC, you’ll burn the corresponding $pstXDC tokens.
5. **Redeem Your XDC**
   * To exit, select **“Request Withdraw XDC”**, which resigns your masternode and starts the withdrawal countdown.
   * After a **32-day waiting period**, your **XDC** and any accrued rewards become available.
   * Redeeming your XDC **burns** the corresponding amount of $pstXDC.
