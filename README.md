### Transition from Old System to New System

1.  **XDC Vaults → XDC Liquid Staking**

    * **Old System:** “XDC Vaults” required a 100 XDC fee to mint and manage your staked tokens.
    * **New System:** **XDC Liquid Staking** replaces XDC Vaults, simplifying the staking process and making it easier to earn rewards.
    * **Refund:** Anyone who paid the 100 XDC minting fee for an XDC Vault and was holding the XDC Vault received a refund: [https://xdcscan.com/tx/0xfe90e35de4d8d9735bf362d877af0c163c7f359b5a2dabdac996dddc71a996bc](https://xdcscan.com/tx/0xfe90e35de4d8d9735bf362d877af0c163c7f359b5a2dabdac996dddc71a996bc)


2.  **$psXDC is the Key to Rewards**

    * **What’s Changing?:** Instead of manually creating Vaults, you now receive **$psXDC** whenever you stake XDC.
    * **Why It Matters:** Holding **$psXDC** is how you earn and claim staking rewards in the updated platform.
    * **Migration Required:** To continue earning rewards, you must migrate your old $pstXDC tokens to the new $psXDC tokens.


3. **Temporary Pause During System Update**
   * **Current Status:** The old system is on hold while we roll out the update.
   * **Rewards Preservation:** Any pending rewards are preserved and will be credited once the transition is complete.
   * **What to Expect:** When the new platform goes live, you can interact with your staked assets in the Liquid Staking system, claim any accumulated rewards, and benefit from an improved user experience.
