# PRFI NFTs

The PRFI NFT collection consists of 4,111 unique digital assets - 4,096 generative and 15 handcrafted. Each NFT combines artistic value with staking utility.

During the minting period, only 2,333 NFTs were minted (roughly half the supply), making the circulating collection inherently scarce.

## Network & Marketplace

PRFI NFTs live on **Base** (Ethereum L2). They are omnichain-capable via LayerZero, meaning they can be bridged to other supported chains while preserving full staking state and reward history.

## Handcrafted NFTs

The first 15 NFTs are handcrafted by [Olatz Diaz](https://olatzdiaz.com/), each representing one of the first 15 prime numbers. These one-of-a-kind artworks will never be minted again.

## Generative NFTs

Each generative NFT is composed of five art elements:

- A prime number
- Sensual vegetation
- A geometric figure
- A feminine shape
- Futuristic background lines with complementary color fades

Prime numbers were generated sequentially at mint time, starting from the 16th up to the 4,111th prime number. Each is unique. The five art elements each have eight variations with different rarity levels, producing 8^5 = 32,768 possible combinations - far more than were ever minted.

## Rarity System

Each NFT's global rarity is determined by averaging the rarity scores of its five art elements (rounded up). The rarity tier sets the NFT's **base multiplier** for staking rewards.

**Example:**
- Vegetation: Mythic (7), Figure: Epic (5), Shape: Legendary (6), Lines: Rare (4), Background: Godly (8)
- Average: (7+5+6+4+8) / 5 = 6.0 → **Legendary**

Higher rarity = higher base multiplier = larger share of the monthly reward pool.
