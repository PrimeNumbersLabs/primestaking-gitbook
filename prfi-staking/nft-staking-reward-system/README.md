# Staking Reward System

## <mark style="color:purple;">Staking Reward System: Transforming Digital Collectibles into Income-Generating Assets</mark>

Prime Numbers Labs introduces the **ONFT Staking Reward System**, transforming static collectibles into powerful yield-bearing assets. By allowing users to stake PRFI tokens into unique NFTs, the system unlocks dynamic financial utility while preserving full ownership and transferability.

***

### <mark style="color:purple;">How It Works: Unlocking the Value of Your NFTs</mark>

The Token Staking Reward System allows users to deposit platform tokens into specific NFTs. This staking process activates reward mechanisms tied to the NFT’s attributes, such as rarity or category, for the duration of the staking period.

* **Staking Mechanism:** Users allocate tokens to selected NFTs. The NFT acts as a staking vehicle, generating rewards proportional to the amount staked, the NFT’s properties, and platform-defined parameters.
* **Dynamic Reward Model:** Rewards are calculated based on factors like the NFT’s rarity tier, staking duration, and overall protocol performance, ensuring that reward distribution remains fair and scalable.

***

### <mark style="color:purple;">Core Features</mark>

* **Token-to-NFT Staking**: Users can deposit PRFI into their NFTs, activating yield potential tied to each NFT’s characteristics.
* **Level Progression**: As stake increases, NFTs progress through levels (1–20), boosting their earning multiplier.
* **Reward Accumulation**: NFTs passively earn PRFI from protocol airdrops, royalties, and DeFi profits.
* **Cross-Chain Operability**: NFTs can be bridged across supported chains (e.g. Ethereum ↔ Base) with full state and reward preservation.

### <mark style="color:purple;">The Benefits of Staking NFTs with Prime Numbers Labs</mark>

* **Enhanced NFT Utility:** Token staking transforms NFTs into active financial instruments, adding a layer of functionality beyond mere ownership.
* **Optimized Returns:** A reward system designed to align with staking behaviour ensures returns to scale with staking input and duration.
* **Collateralized Lending:** Staked NFTs retain their collateralization potential, allowing users to leverage their assets without interrupting staking rewards.
* **Secure and Transparent:** Built on blockchain technology, the system ensures transparency in reward distribution and full security for staked assets.

#### **Technical Overview and Adaptability**

The staking system is built on a **modular, upgradeable architecture (EIP-2535 Diamond Standard)**. Key capabilities include:

* **High-precision reward math** using `ABDKMathQuad`
* **Secure custody** and staking logic on Base mainnet
* **Cross-chain NFT movement** powered by LayerZero
* **Upgradeable contracts** for continuous evolution without redeployment

This architecture supports seamless integration of new features (e.g., PrimeFi, gamified locks, NFT marketplace incentives), ensuring adaptability as the Prime Numbers Labs ecosystem expands.
