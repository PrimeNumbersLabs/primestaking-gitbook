# XDC Liquid Staking System

The XDC Liquid Staking System is the one-and-only way to stake XDC—offering a simple, accessible path for all XDC holders to earn masternode rewards, similar to Lido Finance. There are no high capital requirements, KYC barriers, or hosting costs.

***

### How It Works

#### Stake and Receive $pstXDC (Prime Staked XDC)

* When you stake your XDC, you receive an equal amount of $pstXDC at a 1:1 ratio.
* $pstXDC represents your staked XDC and remains fully liquid—you can trade it or use it in other DeFi applications.

#### Earn Rewards by Holding $pstXDC

* Because $pstXDC is directly tied to your staked XDC, simply **holding $pstXDC entitles you to masternode rewards, which are paid in XDC.**
* If you buy $pstXDC from a DEX, you start receiving rewards right away—no separate staking action is required.

#### Use XDC NFTs for Additional Staking

* You can further stake your $pstXDC inside XDC NFTs, which **also pay rewards in XDC.**
* This allows you to earn extra rewards, whether you hold $pstXDC directly or within these NFTs.

#### Flexible Redemption

* To unstake, you can return your $pstXDC for $XDC on a 1:1 basis, usually taking 1–32 days.
* This ensures you retain liquidity while your original tokens are earning rewards.

### Key Features and Benefits

#### Access Masternode Rewards

Earn masternode rewards without running your own node or needing massive capital.

#### No KYC or High Entry Requirements

Unlike traditional masternodes that might require 10M XDC plus KYC, Liquid Staking welcomes all XDC holders.

#### Lower Costs

Infrastructure and hosting overhead are handled at the protocol level.

#### Liquidity with $pstXDC

$pstXDC can be used across various DeFi services or traded freely, **all while accumulating rewards paid in XDC.**

### Security and Transparency

#### Smart Contract-Driven

All staking operations run on secure, audited smart contracts.

#### Decentralized Reward Distribution

Masternode rewards (paid in XDC) are distributed proportionally and transparently, ensuring fair returns for everyone holding $pstXDC.
