# XDC Staking NFTs

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction to XDC Staking NFTs</mark>

Prime Numbers Labs is proud to introduce the XDC Staking NFTs, the first non-custodial and trustless staking system built on the XDC Network. These NFTs act as secure "vaults," allowing you to store your XDC tokens and earn rewards simultaneously. With a collection of 5,557 NFTs, including 5,542 generative and 15 handcrafted pieces, these NFTs combine utility with artistic value, offering a unique staking experience.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Handmade Prime Numbers NFTs</mark>

The collection includes 15 exclusive, handcrafted NFTs by our Art Director. Owners of these rare NFTs receive three additional XDC Staking NFTs, enhancing their staking capabilities. These NFTs are artistically valuable and come with a **base multiplier of 2**, making them highly sought after for their increased earning potential.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Generative XDC Staking NFTs</mark>

The 5,542 generative NFTs are designed with different rarity levels, each offering a distinct base multiplier that determines the rewards you can earn:

\#1 Plentiful: Base Multiplier: 0.3

\#2 Common: Base Multiplier: 0.4

\#3 Uncommon: Base Multiplier: 0.5

\#4 Rare: Base Multiplier: 0.7

\#5 Epic: Base Multiplier: 0.9

\#6 Legendary: Base Multiplier: 1.2

\#7 Mythic: Base Multiplier: 1.5

\#8 Godly: Base Multiplier: 1.9

These varying levels of rarity ensure that each NFT is unique and valuable, providing both collectors and investors with a range of options to suit their staking strategy.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Merge System</mark>

We are happy to show you how our merge NFTs system works.

**You can merge 2 NFTs of the same rarity to get one of the following rarities.**

Examples: The merge of **2 common NFTs** will make **one uncommon NFT.** The merge of **2 mythic NFTs** will make **one godly NFT.**

**Godly** is the best rarity you can get using the **merge system**.

When you merge 2 NFTs, these 2 NFTs get burned, and you get 1 NFT of the next rarity.

This makes the NFTs deflationary.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Refund System (Not Live)</mark>

**You can use the "BurnToRedeem" button to get 300 $PRFI (Refund System)**

This button breaks the NFT and extracts all the $XDC inside the NFT. It cannot be reversed; it will burn your NFT and send all the XDC to your wallet. Also, you get 300 $PRFI when you break the NFT.

This makes the NFTs deflationary.\
