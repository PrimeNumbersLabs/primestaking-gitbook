# Custody & Key Management

PrimeStaking uses a **permissionless, smart contract-based** validator custody model - eliminating human interaction from custody flows entirely.

---

## How It Works

- **Smart contract-based execution** - validator keys and staked XDC are managed entirely by audited smart contracts, with no human interaction in custody flows.
- **Permissionless** - anyone can verify the state of validators and staked assets on-chain. No centralized approval required.
- **Trustless** - no single entity controls the keys. The protocol enforces custody rules through code, not operational trust.
- **Institutional-grade transparency** - full operational transparency aligned with institutional security standards.

---

## Audit & Collaboration

PrimeStaking's custody infrastructure is developed in collaboration with:

- **Nethermind** - smart contract development and security review
- **XDC Core team** - network-level validator integration

A dedicated audit of the custody contracts is in progress with independent auditors. Full results will be published upon completion.
