Earn rewards on XDC and PRFI tokens without giving up control of your assets.

## Products

| Product | Token | Yield | How It Works |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **XDC Liquid Staking** | XDC | ~4.5% APY | Stake XDC, receive psXDC (1:1). Stay liquid. |
| **XDC NFTs** | psXDC | Up to 6% APY | Deposit psXDC into NFTs. Rarity multiplies rewards. |
| **PRFI NFTs** | PRFI | 100K PRFI/mo pool | Stake PRFI inside NFTs. Rarity determines share. |

### XDC Liquid Staking

The simplest way to earn on your XDC. No NFT required. No minimum amount.

1. **Stake XDC** - Deposit any amount into the liquid staking contract.
2. **Receive psXDC** - You get psXDC at a 1:1 ratio, instantly.
3. **Earn rewards** - Rewards accrue continuously at ~4.5% APY.
4. **Stay liquid** - psXDC is a standard XDC Network token. Hold it, transfer it, or use it in DeFi.
5. **Withdraw anytime** - Burn psXDC to get your XDC back. Withdrawal requests are processed via the validator queue (~31 days average).

### XDC NFTs

A gamified staking layer on top of liquid staking. Deposit psXDC into collectible NFTs to boost your yield.

- Each NFT has a **rarity** (Common → Legendary) that determines the base reward multiplier.
- **Level up** by merging two same-rarity NFTs into a higher tier.
- **Lock** your NFT for 1 year for an additional 1.25% APY bonus (up to 6% total).
- Rewards are paid in XDC and claimable monthly.

### PRFI NFTs

Staking for PRFI token holders. Deposit PRFI into NFTs to earn a share of the monthly reward pool. PRFI NFTs live on the **Base** network (Ethereum L2) and are tradeable on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/primenumbers-prfi-onft).

- 100,000 PRFI distributed monthly across all staked NFTs.
- Higher rarity = higher share of the reward pool.
- Merge NFTs to unlock stronger multipliers and maximize yield.
