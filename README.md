# Overview

PrimeStaking, developed by Prime Numbers Labs, is an advanced derivative staking platform designed to maximize the utility of digital assets. It offers a seamless and efficient way for users to earn rewards by staking their tokens in a secure, user-friendly system. PrimeStaking currently supports two types of staking:

***

#### **1. PRFI Staking**

**For PRFI Token Holders**

* **Purpose:** PRFI Staking enables holders of PRFI tokens to earn rewards by staking their tokens within the PrimeStaking system.
* **Rewards:** Stakers earn multiple types of rewards, including but not limited to:
  * Additional PRFI tokens
  * Participation-based incentives
  * Potential benefits from ecosystem growth
* **Flexibility:** Designed for those looking to grow their PRFI holdings while supporting the PrimeFi ecosystem actively.

***

#### **2. XDC Staking**

**For XDC Token Holders**

* **Purpose:** XDC Staking allows holders of XDC to stake their tokens and earn a variable annual percentage yield (APY).
* **Mechanism:**
  * Users stake $XDC into the system and receive $pstXDC tokens as a liquid staking derivative.
  * $pstXDC tokens represent the staked XDC and can be used in DeFi protocols while still accruing staking rewards.
* **Rewards:** Generated from masternode operations, ensuring participants benefit from the network's growth without needing to meet high entry requirements like KYC or minimum token holdings.
* **Advantages:**
  * Low barriers to entry (no 10M XDC requirement).
  * Liquidity through $pstXDC, allowing for flexible asset utilization.
