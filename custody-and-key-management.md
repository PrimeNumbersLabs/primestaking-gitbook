# Custody & Key Management

PrimeStaking entrusts validator-node keys and staked XDC to **Crypto.com Custody**, a regulated third-party custodian that delivers institutional-grade security while preserving the protocol’s non-custodial user experience.

| Objective                             | Solution                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protect validator keys and user funds | Cold-wallet storage in segregated custody accounts         |
| Eliminate single-operator risk        | Multi-signatory transaction policies and role-based access |
| Maintain on-chain liveness            | 24 / 7 key availability with hardware secure modules       |
| Provide verifiable solvency           | Periodic proof-of-reserves attestations                    |

**Migration Timeline**

1. **Key transfer in progress**– Validator keys encrypted and deposited into cold storage.
2. **Wallet cut-over in progress** – All staking flows are being rerouted; no user action required.
3. **Attestation (Q3 2025)** – Independent auditor to publish proof-of-reserves for custody wallets.

**Impact on Users**

* **No change** to reward rates, lock-up periods, or fee structure.
* Users retain full legal ownership of their XDC; assets cannot be re-hypothecated.
* The protocol’s decentralisation roadmap remains intact, custody secures keys, not consensus.
