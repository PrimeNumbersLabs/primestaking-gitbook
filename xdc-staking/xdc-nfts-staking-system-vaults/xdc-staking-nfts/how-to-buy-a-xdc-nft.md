# How to Buy an XDC NFT

XDC Staking NFTs are available on the [PrimePort marketplace](https://primeport.xyz).

---

## Step 1 - Set Up Your Wallet

Ensure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is configured for the XDC Network. If not already set up, add XDC Network as a custom network in your wallet settings.

## Step 2 - Fund Your Wallet

Make sure you have enough XDC tokens to cover the NFT price plus gas fees. You can purchase XDC on exchanges like Bitrue or KuCoin.

## Step 3 - Browse the Collection

Go to [PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz) and find the **XDC Staking NFTs** collection. Review each NFT's rarity, staking potential, and price.

## Step 4 - Purchase

Connect your wallet, select the NFT you want, click **Buy**, and confirm the transaction. After confirmation, the NFT appears in your profile.
