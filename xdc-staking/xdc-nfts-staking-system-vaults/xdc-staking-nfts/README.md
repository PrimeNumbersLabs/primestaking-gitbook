# XDC NFTs

XDC Staking NFTs are gamified staking vaults on the XDC Network. Each NFT holds psXDC and earns rewards based on its rarity and level — offering higher yields than standard liquid staking.

## How It Works

1. **Get psXDC** — Stake XDC in the liquid staking contract or buy psXDC on a DEX.
2. **Get an NFT** — Buy an XDC Staking NFT on [PrimePort](https://primeport.xyz) or mint one.
3. **Deposit psXDC** — Stake psXDC inside your NFT. This levels up the NFT and activates reward multipliers.
4. **Earn rewards** — XDC rewards are distributed monthly based on your NFT's total multiplier.
5. **Upgrade** — Merge two same-rarity NFTs to create a higher-rarity NFT with better multipliers.
6. **Lock (optional)** — Lock your NFT for an additional 1.25% APY bonus (up to 6% total).

## Rarity Tiers

Each NFT has a rarity that determines its base multiplier:

| Rarity | Base Multiplier |
| --- | --- |
| Plentiful | 0.3 |
| Common | 0.4 |
| Uncommon | 0.5 |
| Rare | 0.7 |
| Epic | 0.9 |
| Legendary | 1.2 |
| Mythic | 1.5 |
| Godly | 1.9 |

Higher rarity = higher base multiplier = larger share of the reward pool.

## Merge System

Combine two NFTs of the **same rarity** to create one NFT of the **next rarity tier**.

- Both original NFTs are burned.
- A new, higher-rarity NFT is minted.
- This makes the collection deflationary over time.
- **Godly** is the highest rarity achievable through merging.

Merge NFTs to unlock stronger multipliers and maximize your yield.
