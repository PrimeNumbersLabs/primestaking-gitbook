### General Questions

#### What is XDC Liquid Staking?

**XDC Liquid Staking** enables you to stake XDC **while retaining full liquidity**. Instead of locking up your tokens, you receive psXDC (Prime Staked XDC) - a liquid staking derivative that can be freely used or traded in DeFi.

- **XDC Liquid Staking:** A straightforward way to stake XDC and receive psXDC - no minimum required. Earns ~4.5% APY.
- **XDC NFTs:** Deposit psXDC inside XDC NFTs for boosted rewards up to 6% APY.

#### What is psXDC?

psXDC is the liquid receipt token representing your staked XDC. Holding psXDC means you **continue to earn staking rewards even as you use or trade it**.

#### Where can I trade psXDC?

You can trade psXDC on the [XSWAP DEX](https://info.xspswap.finance/#/pools/0xc4a0b4ce176c623a281bc565bfd35eab4fd7050a) on the XDC Network, paired with XDC. Purchasing psXDC directly also grants you rewards, since holding it is effectively holding a staked position.

#### What happens when I unstake?

When you decide to unstake, you **burn the corresponding psXDC**. This submits a withdrawal request that is processed via the validator queue (**~31 days average**). Once complete, the XDC returns to your wallet.

#### Is there a faster way to exit?

Yes. You can swap psXDC for XDC instantly on the [XSWAP DEX](https://info.xspswap.finance/#/pools/0xc4a0b4ce176c623a281bc565bfd35eab4fd7050a), bypassing the ~31 day validator queue entirely. The swap is subject to available pool liquidity and the current market rate, which stays close to 1:1.

#### Can I transfer my staking position?

Yes.

- **Liquid Staking:** Send psXDC to another address - whoever holds psXDC is entitled to the associated rewards.
- **XDC NFTs:** If your psXDC is inside an XDC NFT, you can sell or transfer the NFT via [PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz).

#### How are rewards distributed?

Rewards work differently depending on the product:

- **XDC Liquid Staking:** Rewards accrue continuously as validators produce blocks. You hold psXDC and claim your share anytime from the Rewards tab. The reward token is **psXDC**.
- **XDC NFTs:** Rewards are calculated and distributed **monthly** based on your NFT's multiplier. The reward token is **XDC**. Claim from the app once available.

Both systems are on-chain and proportional - but liquid staking accrues continuously while NFT rewards follow a monthly cycle.

#### Is there any risk of slashing?

No. XDC Network uses a masternode model that **does not implement slashing**. Your staked capital is never at risk from validator behavior. This is a structural advantage over ETH-based liquid staking protocols where slashing risk is real.

### XDC NFTs

#### What are XDC Staking NFTs?

**XDC Staking NFTs** offer a gamified approach to staking. You deposit psXDC into an NFT, which has a rarity and level that **determines your staking multiplier and boosts rewards**.

#### How do XDC NFTs work?

1. **Deposit psXDC:** Acquire psXDC (by staking XDC or buying on a DEX) and deposit it into your NFT.
2. **Earn rewards:** The NFT's base rarity and upgrade level (multiplier) determine how much you earn.
3. **Merge:** Combine two NFTs of the same rarity to create a higher-rarity NFT with better multipliers.
4. **Lock (optional):** Lock your NFT for 1 year for an additional 1.25% APY bonus (up to 6% total).

#### What is the Merge System?

If you have two NFTs of the same rarity, you can **merge** them into a single higher-rarity NFT. Both originals are burned and a new one is minted. Higher rarity means a **better multiplier and more rewards**. Because merging burns NFTs, the collection becomes **more scarce over time** - making remaining NFTs increasingly valuable.

#### How do I sell my XDC NFT?

List or auction your XDC NFT on **[PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz)**. When purchased, the buyer gains ownership of all staked psXDC and any reward multipliers or locked status the NFT carries.

### XDC Liquid Staking

#### How does Liquid Staking work?

1. **Stake XDC** through the Liquid Staking contract.
2. **Receive psXDC** at a 1:1 ratio.
3. **Earn rewards** continuously at ~4.5% APY.
4. **Withdraw** by burning psXDC. Requests are processed via the validator queue (~31 days average), or swap instantly on [XSWAP](https://info.xspswap.finance/#/pools/0xc4a0b4ce176c623a281bc565bfd35eab4fd7050a).

#### Who can participate?

Anyone. There is **no minimum XDC required**. It's accessible to all XDC holders.

#### How do I withdraw my staked XDC?

You have two options:

- **Standard withdrawal:** Submit a withdrawal request from the app. You burn the equivalent amount of psXDC, and your original XDC is released back to your wallet after processing through the validator queue (~31 days average).
- **Instant exit:** Swap psXDC for XDC on [XSWAP DEX](https://info.xspswap.finance/#/pools/0xc4a0b4ce176c623a281bc565bfd35eab4fd7050a) for immediate liquidity (subject to available pool depth).

#### Can I transfer my Liquid Staking position?

Yes. Send psXDC to another address - whoever holds psXDC is entitled to the associated rewards. No NFT required.
