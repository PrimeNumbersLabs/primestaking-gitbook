# XDC Staking NFTs Mechanics

**Understanding XDC Staking NFTs: Maximizing Your Rewards**

**XDC Staking NFTs** introduce a dynamic, gamified staking system within **Prime Numbers Labs**, allowing you to stake **$psXDC** (not regular XDC) to earn various rewards. These NFTs are **liquid** and designed to integrate seamlessly with the **XDC Liquid Staking** ecosystem, providing enhanced flexibility and utility.

***

### How It Works

#### Staking Your $psXDC Tokens

* **Stake $psXDC:** Acquire $psXDC (by depositing XDC in the Liquid Staking platform or purchasing on a DEX) and stake it inside your NFT. This boosts the NFT’s intrinsic value and unlocks rewards from the **XDC rewards pool**.
* **Withdrawal Flexibility:** Your staked $psXDC remains secure and can be withdrawn at any time unless you opt to lock the NFT in a masternode for additional yield.

#### Leveling Up and Multipliers

* **NFT Levels:** As you stake more $psXDC, your NFT’s level increases.
* **Base + Added Multipliers:** Each level adds an **Added Multiplier** to the NFT’s **Base Multiplier**, resulting in a **Total Multiplier**.
  * **Example:** Base Multiplier = 2.0, Level 18 Added Multiplier = 1.8 ⇒ **Total Multiplier = 3.8**.
* **Greater Rewards:** A higher Total Multiplier grants you a larger share of the rewards pool.

#### Rewards and Maximum Staking

* **Staking Limit:** You can stake up to **100,000 $psXDC** inside each NFT.

### Key Features of Liquid XDC NFTs

1. **Liquidity Through $psXDC**
   * Stake $psXDC instead of locking raw XDC, preserving your liquidity options while still earning rewards.
2. **Gamified Staking**
   * Level up and customize your NFTs to enhance multipliers, adding a **fun, dynamic** aspect to the staking experience.
3. **Secure and Flexible**
   * All operations use **audited smart contracts**; you can withdraw staked $psXDC or utilize it in DeFi at any time (unless the NFT is locked).
4. **Enhanced Rewards**
   * Combining **Liquid Staking** with NFT-based multipliers lets you **maximize yields** and tailor your staking strategy.

XDC Staking NFTs combine the power of staking and liquidity, allowing you to maximize rewards while enjoying the utility of liquid staking derivatives. With features akin to XDC Vaults, these NFTs are a versatile and powerful addition to the Prime Numbers Labs ecosystem.
