## How APY Breaks Down

| Component | Rate | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base liquid staking | 4.5% | Hold psXDC |
| NFT staking bonus | +0.25% | Deposit psXDC into an XDC NFT |
| NFT lock bonus | +1.25% | Lock the NFT (disables burn, merge, and withdraw) |
| **Maximum total** | **6%** | NFT staked + locked |

## How Rewards Are Calculated

- **Proportional distribution** — Rewards are allocated based on how much psXDC you hold (or have staked inside an NFT) relative to the total supply.
- **On-chain and transparent** — Every reward event is logged on the blockchain.
- **Claim anytime** — Rewards accrue continuously. Go to the **Rewards** tab in the app and claim to your wallet whenever you want.

## Why Multiple Tiers?

| Goal | Best Option |
| --- | --- |
| Keep it simple, stay fully liquid | XDC Liquid Staking (~4.5%) |
| Earn more while engaging with the NFT ecosystem | XDC NFTs Unlocked (~4.75%) |
| Maximize yield, comfortable with locking | XDC NFTs Locked (up to 6%) |

Each tier builds on the previous one. Start with liquid staking and move into NFTs when you're ready — there is no pressure to lock.
