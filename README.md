## Transition from Old System to New System

### 1. XDC Vaults → XDC Liquid Staking

* **Old System:** “XDC Vaults” required a 100 XDC fee to mint and manage your staked tokens.
* **New System:** **XDC Liquid Staking** replaces XDC Vaults, simplifying the process of staking and earning rewards.
* **Refund:** Anyone who paid the 100 XDC minting fee for an XDC Vault will be **refunded** that amount in the new system.

### 2. $pstXDC is the Key to Rewards

* **What’s Changing?:** Instead of manually managing Vaults, you now receive **$pstXDC** whenever you stake XDC.
* **Why It Matters:** Holding **$pstXDC** is how you **earn and claim** staking rewards in the updated platform.

### 3. Temporary Pause During System Update

* **Current Status:** The old system is **on hold** while the update is being rolled out.
* **Rewards Preservation:** All pending rewards are **saved** and will be fully credited **once the transition is complete**.
* **What to Expect:** Once the new platform goes live, you’ll be able to interact with your staked assets in the Liquid Staking system, claim any accumulated rewards, and enjoy the **improved** user experience.
