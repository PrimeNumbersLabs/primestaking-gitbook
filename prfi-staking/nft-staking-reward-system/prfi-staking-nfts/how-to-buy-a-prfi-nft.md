## Step 1 — Set Up Your Wallet

Connect your wallet to the XDC Network. If using MetaMask, add XDC Network as a custom network under **Settings > Networks > Add Network**.

Ensure your wallet has enough PRFI or XDC to cover the NFT price plus gas fees.

## Step 4 — Purchase

Connect your wallet to PrimePort, select your NFT, click **Buy**, and confirm the transaction. Verify your purchase in the **My Profile** section.
