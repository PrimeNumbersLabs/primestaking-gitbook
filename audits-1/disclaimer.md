### Risk Disclosure & Disclaimer

**Applies to:** PrimeStaking smart contracts, interfaces, and related documentation operated by **Prime Numbers Labs** (or its affiliates) ("PrimeStaking", "we", "us", "our").

> **Summary:** Using blockchain protocols is risky. **You can lose some or all of your assets.** Smart contracts may have bugs or be exploited. Network conditions, third-party services, markets, or protocol updates can change outcomes. **There are no guaranteed returns.** Proceed only if you understand and accept these risks.

#### 1. No Warranties; As-Is

PrimeStaking and all related smart contracts, interfaces, tokens (including psXDC), NFTs, rewards, and documentation are provided **"as is" and "as available"** without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties.

#### 2. Smart Contract & Security Risks

Interacting with smart contracts involves risks including bugs, design flaws, upgrade errors, dependency failures, and economic attacks. Even audited contracts do **not guarantee** absence of vulnerabilities. You may lose funds due to exploits or unexpected behavior.

#### 3. Network & Validator Risks

Rewards and redemptions depend on third-party networks (e.g., XDC Network). Network halts, forks, validator downtime, or congestion can reduce yields, delay withdrawal processing (~31 days average), or impair liquidity.

#### 4. Derivative & Peg Risks

psXDC may trade below, at, or above its intended reference value and may not be redeemable immediately. A 1:1 mint ratio does not guarantee a 1:1 market value.

#### 5. Third-Party Custody

Validator key management and staked assets may involve regulated third-party custody (e.g., Crypto.com Custody). We do not assume responsibility for their acts, omissions, solvency, or security.

#### 6. Variable Rewards

Any APY, multiplier, or reward figure is **illustrative only, subject to change, and not guaranteed**. Rewards can fluctuate to zero. Historical performance does not indicate future results.

#### 7. User Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for private keys, wallet security, address accuracy, transaction review, and understanding contract addresses.

#### 8. Regulatory & Tax

You are responsible for complying with applicable laws, including sanctions, AML/CTF, and tax reporting. Access may be restricted in certain jurisdictions.

#### 9. No Investment Advice

Nothing herein constitutes financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.

#### 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, data, or assets.

#### 11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PrimeStaking and its contributors from claims arising from your use or violation of these terms.
