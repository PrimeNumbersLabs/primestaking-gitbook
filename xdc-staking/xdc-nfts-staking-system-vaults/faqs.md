### General Questions

#### What is XDC Liquid Staking?

**XDC Liquid Staking** enables you to stake XDC **while retaining full liquidity**. Instead of locking up your tokens, you receive psXDC (Prime Staked XDC) - a liquid staking derivative that can be freely used or traded in DeFi.

- **XDC Liquid Staking:** A straightforward way to stake XDC and receive psXDC - no minimum required. Earns ~4.5% APY.
- **XDC NFTs:** Deposit psXDC inside XDC NFTs for boosted rewards up to 6% APY.

#### What is psXDC?

psXDC is the liquid receipt token representing your staked XDC. Holding psXDC means you **continue to earn staking rewards even as you use or trade it**.

#### Where can I trade psXDC?

You can trade psXDC on **DEXs** on the XDC Network, typically paired with XDC. Purchasing psXDC directly also grants you rewards, since holding it is effectively holding a staked position.

#### What happens when I unstake?

When you decide to unstake, you **burn the corresponding psXDC**. This submits a withdrawal request that is processed via the validator queue (**~31 days average**). Once complete, the XDC returns to your wallet.

#### Can I transfer my staking position?

Yes.

- **Liquid Staking:** Send psXDC to another address - whoever holds psXDC is entitled to the associated rewards.
- **XDC NFTs:** If your psXDC is inside an XDC NFT, you can sell or transfer the NFT via [PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz).

#### How are rewards distributed?

Rewards are sent to the smart contract and allocated proportionally to psXDC holders and to XDC NFTs with staked psXDC. You claim your share from the Rewards tab in the app.

### XDC NFTs

#### What are XDC Staking NFTs?

**XDC Staking NFTs** offer a gamified approach to staking. You deposit psXDC into an NFT, which has a rarity and level that **determines your staking multiplier and boosts rewards**.

#### How do XDC NFTs work?

1. **Deposit psXDC:** Acquire psXDC (by staking XDC or buying on a DEX) and deposit it into your NFT.
2. **Earn rewards:** The NFT's base rarity and upgrade level (multiplier) determine how much you earn.
3. **Merge:** Combine two NFTs of the same rarity to create a higher-rarity NFT with better multipliers.
4. **Lock (optional):** Lock your NFT for 1 year for an additional 1.25% APY bonus (up to 6% total).

#### What is the Merge System?

If you have two NFTs of the same rarity, you can **merge** them into a single higher-rarity NFT. Higher rarity means a **better multiplier and more rewards**. Merge NFTs to unlock stronger multipliers and maximize your yield.

#### How do I sell my XDC NFT?

List or auction your XDC NFT on **[PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz)**. When purchased, the buyer gains ownership of all staked psXDC and any reward multipliers or locked status the NFT carries.
