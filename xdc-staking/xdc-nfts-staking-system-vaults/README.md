# XDC Liquid Staking System

**Stake Your $XDC. Earn $XDC from Masternodes!**\
The **XDC Liquid Staking System** is the one-and-only way to stake XDC—offering a simple, accessible path for all XDC holders to earn masternode rewards, similar to Lido Finance. There are no high capital requirements, KYC barriers, or hosting costs.

***

### How It Works

1. **Stake and Receive $pstXDC (Prime Staked XDC)**
   * When you stake your XDC, you receive an equal amount of $pstXDC at a **1:1 ratio**.
   * $pstXDC represents your staked XDC and remains fully liquid—you can trade it or use it in other DeFi applications.
2. **Earn Rewards by Holding $pstXDC**
   * Because $pstXDC is directly tied to your staked XDC, simply **holding** $pstXDC entitles you to masternode rewards.
   * If you **buy $pstXDC from a DEX**, you start receiving rewards right away—no separate staking action is required.
3. **Use XDC NFTs for Additional Staking**
   * You can further stake your $pstXDC inside **XDC NFTs**, which also pay rewards in $pstXDC.
   * This allows you to earn extra rewards, whether you hold $pstXDC directly or within these NFTs.
4. **Flexible Redemption**
   * To **unstake**, you can return your $pstXDC for $XDC on a **1:1 basis**, usually taking **1–32 days**.
   * This ensures you retain liquidity while your original tokens are earning rewards.
