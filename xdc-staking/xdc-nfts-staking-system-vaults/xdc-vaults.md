#### **What Are XDC Vaults?**

XDC Vaults are on-chain smart contract-based storage solutions where users deposit their $XDC tokens for staking. Upon depositing, users receive $pstXDC, a liquid staking derivative representing their staked $XDC.

***

#### **Key Features**

1. **Staking Interface:**
   * XDC Vaults are the liquid staking system's gateway for staking $XDC.
   * Users can mint a Vault directly from the staking platform and deposit their $XDC tokens. It costs only 100 XDC to mint an XDC Vault.
2. **$pstXDC Minting:**
   * Once $XDC tokens are deposited, the vault automatically issues an equivalent amount of $pstXDC to the user’s wallet.
   * The $pstXDC tokens maintain a 1:1 ratio with staked $XDC and serve as proof of ownership.
3. **Rewards Accrual:**
   * While $XDC is locked in the Vault, it participates in the masternode system to generate staking rewards.
   * Rewards are credited periodically to the user’s Vault and reflected in the overall balance of staked tokens.
4. **Liquidity Through $pstXDC:**
   * $pstXDC tokens are liquid and can be used in various DeFi applications, such as lending, trading, or providing liquidity.
   * Non-Locked: Users can use $pstXDC at any time to withdraw their original $XDC and accumulated rewards.
5. **Flexible Exit:**
   * Upon unstaking, $pstXDC is burned, and the equivalent amount of $XDC is returned to the user’s wallet.
