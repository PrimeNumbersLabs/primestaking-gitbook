**XDC Liquid Staking FAQ**

This FAQ covers common questions about the **XDC Liquid Staking System**, which includes **XDC NFTs, XDC Vaults, and XDC Masternode Vaults**.

***

#### **General Questions**

**What is XDC Liquid Staking?**

XDC Liquid Staking allows users to stake XDC and earn rewards while maintaining liquidity. Staked XDC generates **$pstXDC**, which can be used in DeFi without locking up funds. Users can stake in three ways:

1. **XDC NFTs** – Rewards from masternodes and PrimeFi XDC ecosystem.
2. **XDC Vaults** – Open staking with no minimum requirements.
3. **XDC Masternode Vaults** – High-value staking for 10M+ XDC holders.

**What is $pstXDC?**

$pstXDC is a liquid staking derivative (LSD) token issued when users stake XDC. It allows users to earn staking rewards while using their staked assets in DeFi.

**Where can I trade $pstXDC?**

$pstXDC can be traded on **XSWAP DEX**, where it is paired with XDC.

**What happens when I unstake?**

When you unstake, the corresponding $pstXDC tokens are burned, and your staked XDC is returned to your wallet.

**Can I transfer my staking position?**

Yes! XDC NFTs and XDC Vaults can be sold or transferred on [**Primeport.xyz**](https://primeport.xyz).\


**What happens when I claim rewards?**

* **$pstXDC gets minted to the wallet.**
* **XDC Masternode Vaults receive XDC directly.**

**How does the team distribute rewards?**

* **The team sends the rewards to the smart contract, which distributes the XDC to the NFTs.**
* **Users receive their rewards when they claim.**

#### **XDC NFTs**

**What are XDC Staking NFTs?**

XDC Staking NFTs allow users to stake XDC while benefiting from unique rarity-based multipliers. These NFTs provide an interactive and customizable staking experience.

**How do XDC NFTs work?**

* XDC is staked inside the NFT.
* The NFT earns rewards based on its staking level and rarity.
* Users can **merge NFTs** to create higher-rarity NFTs with better rewards.
* Users can **lock NFTs** into masternodes for additional staking bonuses.

**What is the Merge System?**

The Merge System allows users to combine two NFTs of the same rarity to create a **higher-rarity NFT** with better staking benefits.

**Can I withdraw my XDC from an NFT?**

Yes, but withdrawing XDC **burns $pstXDC** in the process. The NFT itself is not burned unless merged.

**How do I sell my XDC NFT?**

XDC NFTs can be listed and auctioned on **PrimePort.xyz**, where buyers can purchase them along with their staked XDC.

#### **XDC Vaults**

**What are XDC Vaults?**

XDC Vaults are **on-chain staking contracts** where users can stake XDC and receive $pstXDC in return, enabling flexible and liquid staking.

**How do XDC Vaults work?**

* Users stake XDC in a vault and receive $pstXDC tokens.
* $pstXDC can be used in DeFi while still earning staking rewards.
* When unstaking, $pstXDC is burned, and XDC is returned.

**Who can use XDC Vaults?**

Anyone can stake in XDC Vaults. There are no minimum staking requirements.

**How do I withdraw my XDC from a Vault?**

To withdraw XDC:

1. Burn the required amount of $pstXDC.
2. Your XDC will be returned to your wallet.

**Can I transfer my XDC Vault?**

Yes! Vaults can be transferred or sold on **PrimePort.xyz**, provided the owner holds all corresponding $pstXDC tokens.

#### **XDC Masternode Vaults**

**What are XDC Masternode Vaults?**

XDC Masternode Vaults allow **large holders (10M+ XDC)** to stake directly into masternodes and earn exclusive rewards.

**What are the benefits of using Masternode Vaults?**

* Higher staking rewards compared to standard XDC Vaults.
* No need for technical setup – automated staking.
* Exclusive reward tiers for large-scale participants.

**Can I unstake from an XDC Masternode Vault?**

Yes, but unstaking may have a cooldown period due to masternode operations.

**Can I transfer my Masternode Vault?**

Yes! Masternode Vaults can be sold or transferred on **PrimePort.xyz**, ensuring ownership and rewards are passed to the new holder.

***

#### **Security & Restrictions**

**What happens if I don’t hold my $pstXDC?**

* You **cannot** claim rewards if you do not hold **100% of your corresponding $pstXDC**.
* You **cannot** mint a new Vault if you owe $pstXDC to the contract.
* You **cannot** stake more XDC until you settle your $pstXDC balance.

**What if my NFT is locked in a masternode?**

* Locked NFTs **cannot be merged, withdrawn, or burned** until unlocked.
* Locked NFTs earn an **extra 7% annual staking rewards**.

**How is $pstXDC burned?**

* $pstXDC is **burned** when users withdraw their staked XDC from Vaults or NFTs.
* This ensures that rewards remain balanced and prevent inflationary abuse.
