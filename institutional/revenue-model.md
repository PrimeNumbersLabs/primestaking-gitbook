# Revenue Model

PrimeStaking generates revenue from staking operations on the XDC Network. Partners participate in this revenue through transparent, on-chain fee structures.

## Fee Structure

### Staking Fee

A percentage of staking rewards is retained by the protocol as a service fee before distribution to users.

| Parameter | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Fee basis** | Percentage of validator rewards generated |
| **Applied to** | XDC Liquid Staking rewards |
| **Transparency** | On-chain, auditable |
| **User-facing APY** | Net of fees (~4.5% APY after protocol fee) |

---

## Revenue Sharing for Partners

Partners earn a share of the staking fees generated through their integration.

| Model | Revenue Share Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| **White Label** | Custom revenue share on staking fees from partner-referred TVL |
| **Powered by Prime** | Standard revenue share on fees from embedded widget users |

Revenue share percentages are negotiated during the partnership agreement and are based on:

- Expected TVL contribution
- Integration model (White Label vs. Powered by Prime)
- Support and operational commitments

## Settlement & Reporting

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Settlement frequency** | Monthly |
| **Data source** | On-chain events (staking, rewards, withdrawals) |
| **Reconciliation** | Automated reporting with transaction-level detail |
| **Proof of reserves** | On-chain verifiable at any time |

Partners receive monthly settlement reports with:

- Total TVL managed through their integration
- Gross staking rewards generated
- Protocol fees deducted
- Partner revenue share
- Net user distributions

---

## Revenue Sustainability

PrimeStaking's revenue model is tied to real validator economics on the XDC Network:

- **Validator rewards** are generated by the XDC Network consensus mechanism
- **No token emissions** are required to sustain yield - rewards come from network staking
- **Protocol fees** are a percentage of actual rewards, not inflationary tokenomics
- **Scalable** - revenue grows linearly with TVL without additional infrastructure cost per user
