# XDC Masternode Vaults

**XDC Masternode Vaults: High-Value Staking at 7.65% APY**\
XDC Masternode Vaults are designed for users holding 10M XDC or more who wish to operate an XDC masternode. These Vaults streamline masternode operations, reward management, and hosting expenses—while offering liquidity through **$psXDC** tokens.

### What Are XDC Masternode Vaults?

* **Specialized Staking**: Exclusively for users with 10M XDC, making it easy to run and maintain a masternode.
* **Higher Rewards**: Earn 7.65% APY from masternode rewards.
* **Liquid Staking Derivative**: When staking 10M XDC, you receive 10M **$psXDC**, which can be used in DeFi without losing your masternode rewards.

### How It Works

#### Mint an XDC Masternode Vault

Users with 10M XDC can create a masternode vault, represented as an NFT that manages the staked tokens.

#### Receive Liquid Staking Tokens

Once you stake 10M XDC, the system automatically issues 10M **$psXDC** to your wallet.\
&#xNAN;**$psXDC** proves your staked tokens and remains fully usable in the ecosystem (e.g., DeFi protocols), without affecting your masternode earnings.

#### Earn Masternode Rewards

Your staked XDC generates rewards at 7.65% APY.\
The platform takes 0.35% (from the total 8% APY) to cover hosting and operational fees.\
Rewards are credited proportionally to your masternode vault balance.

#### Maintain Liquidity Through $psXDC

**$psXDC** maintains a 1:1 ratio with your staked XDC, so you can trade or stake it elsewhere while still collecting masternode rewards.\
If you ever wish to redeem your XDC, you’ll burn the corresponding **$psXDC** tokens.

#### Redeem Your XDC

To exit, select “Request Withdraw XDC,” which resigns your masternode and starts the withdrawal countdown.\
After a 32-day waiting period, your XDC and any accrued rewards become available.\
Redeeming your XDC burns the corresponding amount of **$psXDC**.
