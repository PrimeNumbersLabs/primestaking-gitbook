# Overview

**PrimeStaking** is an innovative platform designed to **maximize the utility** of digital assets. It offers a **seamless, secure**, and **efficient** way for users to earn rewards by staking their tokens. PrimeStaking currently supports **two primary categories** of staking:

***

### 1. PRFI Staking

**For PRFI Token Holders**

* **Purpose:** Allows holders of **PRFI tokens** to stake within the PrimeStaking system and earn additional **PRFI rewards**.
* **Rewards:**
  * Extra **PRFI** tokens
  * **Participation-based incentives**
  * Potential gains from **ecosystem growth**
* **Flexibility:** Ideal for users who wish to **grow** their PRFI holdings while supporting the **PrimeFi** ecosystem.

### 2. XDC Liquid Staking

**For XDC Token Holders**

**XDC Liquid Staking** provides XDC holders with a flexible, **liquid-staking derivative** called **$pstXDC**. By staking XDC (and receiving $pstXDC in return), participants remain active in DeFi without permanently locking their funds.\
There are three main approaches:

#### A. Standard XDC Liquid Staking

* **Purpose:** A **straightforward** method to stake XDC and receive $pstXDC—**no minimum requirements**.
* **Mechanism:**
  1. Users stake XDC in the **Liquid Staking** protocol.
  2. The system issues **$pstXDC** (1:1) to represent the staked XDC.
  3. **$pstXDC** can be used in DeFi while still accruing staking rewards.
* **Advantages:**
  * **Low barriers** to entry—anyone can participate.
  * **Liquidity**: $pstXDC lets you utilize your staked assets across DeFi while earning rewards.

#### B. XDC NFTs

* **Purpose:** A **gamified** staking option for those seeking **higher rewards** by staking **$pstXDC** inside an NFT.
* **Mechanism:**
  1. Users deposit **$pstXDC** (instead of raw XDC) into the NFT.
  2. Each NFT has **unique rarity** and **multiplier** levels that affect reward rates.
  3. Merging two NFTs of the same rarity can create a **higher-rarity NFT** with enhanced multipliers.
* **Advantages:**
  * **Interactive staking**: Transform staking into a collectible and upgradable experience.
  * **Higher rewards**: Rare or leveled-up NFTs yield better returns, adding a strategic element for holders.

#### C. XDC Masternode Staking

* **Purpose:** Tailored for **10M+ XDC** holders seeking **premium rewards**.
* **Mechanism:**
  1. Large XDC holders stake in a **masternode** framework without needing their own technical setup.
  2. Rewards are **automated** and often higher than standard Liquid Staking.
* **Advantages:**
  * **Exclusive yields** from masternode operations.
  * **Minimal overhead**: No server hosting or technical maintenance required.

#### Summary of XDC Liquid Staking Options

1. **Standard XDC Liquid Staking** – **Low-entry** path to receive $pstXDC and maintain **full DeFi liquidity**.
2. **XDC NFTs** – Gamified approach using **$pstXDC** inside NFTs; unique rarity and multipliers can **boost rewards** beyond standard staking.
3. **XDC Masternode Staking** – Ideal for **10M+ XDC** holders seeking **premium rewards** with minimal overhead.

By **unifying** **PRFI Staking** and **XDC Liquid Staking** under one umbrella, **PrimeStaking** offers multiple avenues for **passive income** and **ecosystem engagement**—whether you’re a **PRFI** supporter, an **XDC** enthusiast, or a large-scale masternode participant.
