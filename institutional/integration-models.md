# Integration Models

PrimeStaking offers two integration models for exchanges, custodians, and institutional partners. Both leverage the same audited, battle-tested infrastructure.

---

## Model A - White Label

**Your brand. Our infrastructure.**

The partner operates XDC staking under their own brand, powered by PrimeStaking's architecture. End users interact with the partner's interface and never see PrimeStaking branding.

### What We Provide

- Full access to the liquid staking contract suite
- Managed validator infrastructure with SLA
- Settlement reconciliation data and on-chain proof of reserves
- Dedicated partner support during and after integration

### Partner Responsibilities

- Frontend development and UX under their own brand
- User onboarding, KYC/AML (if applicable)
- Customer support (Tier 1)
- Regulatory compliance in their jurisdiction

---

## Model B - Powered by Prime

**Co-branded integration. Minimal technical lift.**

The partner integrates PrimeStaking with visible "Powered by PrimeStaking" branding. This model requires significantly less development effort.

### What We Provide

- Drop-in staking UI that partners can embed directly
- Co-branded experience with partner logo alongside PrimeStaking branding
- Managed infrastructure including validator operations, reward distribution, and withdrawal processing
- Standard on-chain reporting

### Partner Responsibilities

- Embed the PrimeStaking widget in their platform
- Direct users to the staking interface
- Optional: provide supplementary user support
