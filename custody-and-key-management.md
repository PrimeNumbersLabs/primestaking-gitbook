# Custody & Key Management

PrimeStaking is transitioning to a fully **permissionless and trustless** validator custody model powered by on-chain smart contracts.

---

## Current Status

Following the completion of our smart contract audit, PrimeStaking will deploy a **contract-based validator custody system**. This means:

- **No third-party custodian** — validator keys and staked XDC are managed entirely by audited smart contracts.
- **Permissionless** — anyone can verify the state of validators and staked assets on-chain.
- **Trustless** — no single entity controls the keys. The protocol enforces custody rules through code, not operational trust.

## What This Means for Users

| Property | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Custody model** | Smart contract-based (no third-party custodian) |
| **Key management** | Validator keys secured by on-chain contracts |
| **Verifiability** | Fully transparent and auditable on the blockchain |
| **User action required** | None — the transition is seamless |

---

## Timeline

1. **Smart contract audit** — In progress. The custody contract is being audited by an independent firm.
2. **Deployment** — Within weeks of audit completion, the contract-based custody will go live.
3. **Full decentralization** — Once deployed, validator custody becomes fully permissionless and trustless.

## Impact on Users

- **No change** to reward rates, withdrawal times, or fee structure.
- Users retain **full ownership** of their assets at all times.
- The move to contract-based custody eliminates reliance on any centralized custodian, strengthening the protocol's decentralization.
