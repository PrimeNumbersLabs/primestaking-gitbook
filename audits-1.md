# Audits

## Security Audits

Code integrity is the cornerstone of PrimeStaking.\
Therefore, **all our staking-related smart contracts** undergo independent\
external audits before deployment and whenever significant updates are\
introduced.

***

### Methodology

1. **Reputable external auditor**\
   We partner with leading firms (e.g., **QuillAudits**) that review every   \
   line of code and validate the economic logic of the contracts.
2. **Two-phase process**
   * _Preliminary report_: identification of findings.
   * _Fix & Verify_: the engineering team resolves issues and requests     \
     final verification.
3. **Transparent disclosure**\
   We publish the full reports so the community can verify the scope of   \
   the analysis and the fixes applied.
