# Disclaimer

### Risk Disclosure & Disclaimer **Applies to:** prime‑staking smart contracts, interfaces, and related docs/content operated by **Prime Numbers Labs** (or its affiliates) (“**PrimeStaking**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”).

> **Plain‑English summary (non‑exhaustive):**\
> Using blockchain protocols is risky. **You can lose some or all of your assets.** Smart contracts may have bugs or be exploited. Network conditions, third‑party services, markets, or our own updates can change outcomes. **There are no guaranteed returns.** Proceed only if you understand and accept these risks.

#### 1) No Warranties; As‑Is

PrimeStaking and all related smart contracts, interfaces, tokens (including derivatives such as **$psXDC**), NFTs, rewards, and documentation are provided **“as is” and “as available”** without warranties of any kind, express or implied (including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non‑infringement). To the maximum extent permitted by law, we **disclaim all warranties**.

#### 2) Protocol, Smart‑Contract & Security Risks

Interacting with smart contracts involves risks including **bugs, design flaws, upgrade errors, dependency failures, governance errors, oracle issues, and economic attacks (e.g., MEV, sandwiching, depeg)**. Even if audited, **audits do not guarantee** absence of vulnerabilities or future safety. You acknowledge you **may lose funds** due to exploits or unexpected behavior. [PrimeStaking](https://docs.primestaking.xyz/audits-1)

#### 3) Network & Validator Risks

Rewards and redemptions depend on third‑party networks (e.g., XDC). Network halts, forks, validator downtime, misbehavior, slashing/penalties (if any), or congestion can reduce or eliminate yields, delay **unstaking/redemption windows (e.g., \~1–32 days)**, or impair liquidity. [PrimeStaking](https://docs.primestaking.xyz/xdc-staking/xdc-nfts-staking-system-vaults/faqs)

#### 4) Derivatives & Peg/Conversion Risks

Liquid staking derivatives such as **$psXDC** may trade below, at, or above their intended reference value and **may not be redeemable immediately**. Redemption queues, caps, or third‑party integrations can change at any time. **A 1:1 mint ratio (when live) does not guarantee a 1:1 market value.** [PrimeStaking](https://docs.primestaking.xyz/xdc-staking/xdc-nfts-staking-system-vaults?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

#### 5) Third‑Party Custody & Service Providers

Elements of validator key management and/or staked assets may involve **regulated third‑party custody**. These providers, exchanges, or integrations (wallets, bridges, DEXs, NFT marketplaces) are **not controlled by us**. We **do not assume responsibility** for their acts, omissions, solvency, or security. [PrimeStaking](https://docs.primestaking.xyz/custody-and-key-management)

#### 6) Variable Rewards; No Guaranteed Returns

Any APY/APR, multiplier, or reward figure is **illustrative only, subject to change, and not guaranteed**. Rewards can fluctuate to **zero**. Historical performance does **not** indicate future results. [PrimeStaking](https://docs.primestaking.xyz/xdc-staking/xdc-nfts-staking-system-vaults/xdc-liquid-staking/xdc-staking-rewards?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

#### 7) User Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for **private keys, wallet security**, address accuracy, transaction review, fee settings, chain selection, and understanding contract addresses. We **do not** and **cannot** recover lost private keys or assets.

#### 8) Regulatory, Tax & Eligibility

You are responsible for complying with **applicable laws**, including sanctions, AML/CTF, and **tax** reporting/withholding. Access may be restricted in certain jurisdictions or to certain persons (e.g., sanctioned countries).

#### 9) No Investment, Legal, or Tax Advice

Nothing herein constitutes financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Do your own research and consult qualified professionals.

#### 10) Limitation of Liability

To the **maximum extent permitted by law**, **we are not liable** for any **indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages**, or for **lost profits, lost revenue, lost data, or lost assets**, or for **security breaches, hacks, exploits, or protocol/network failures**, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility.&#x20;

#### 11) Indemnity

You agree to **indemnify and hold harmless** PrimeStaking and its contributors from claims or demands (including legal fees) arising from your use, misuse, or violation of these terms or of applicable law.
