### General Questions

#### What is XDC Liquid Staking?

**XDC Liquid Staking** enables you to stake $XDC while retaining full liquidity. Instead of locking up your tokens, you receive **$pstXDC** (Prime Staked XDC) – a **liquid staking derivative** – which can be freely used or traded in DeFi.

* **XDC NFTs:** Stake $pstXDC inside **XDC NFTs** to earn masternode rewards plus additional bonuses from the PrimeFi ecosystem.
* **XDC Liquid Staking (Standard):** A straightforward way to stake XDC and receive $pstXDC—no minimum required.
* **XDC Masternode Staking:** For large holders (10M+ XDC), stake in a masternode setting for **enhanced yields**.

#### What is $pstXDC?

**$pstXDC** represents your staked XDC in liquid form. Holding $pstXDC means you continue to earn staking rewards even as you use or trade it.

#### Where can I trade $pstXDC?

You can trade $pstXDC on **DEXs**, where it typically pairs with $XDC. Purchasing $pstXDC directly also grants you rewards, since you’re effectively holding the staked position.

#### What happens when I unstake?

When you decide to unstake your XDC, you **burn** the corresponding $pstXDC—this process redeems your original XDC. After any required waiting period (usually **1–32 days**), the XDC returns to your wallet.

#### Can I transfer my staking position?

Yes!

* **XDC NFTs** (which contain staked $pstXDC) can be sold or transferred, typically via [PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz).
* **XDC Masternode Staking** can also be transferred by passing ownership of the staking contract (and associated $pstXDC) to the new owner.

#### How does the team distribute rewards?

The team sends rewards to a **smart contract** that allocates them proportionally to **$pstXDC** holders or to **XDC NFTs** staked with $pstXDC. You receive your share upon **claiming**.

### XDC NFTs

#### What are XDC Staking NFTs?

**XDC Staking NFTs** is a **gamified** approach to staking, allowing you to deposit **$pstXDC** into the NFT. Each NFT can have a **rarity** and **level** that determines your **staking multiplier** and boosts rewards.

#### How do XDC NFTs work?

1. **Stake $pstXDC**: Acquire $pstXDC (by staking XDC through Liquid Staking or buying it on a DEX) and deposit it into your NFT.
2. **NFT Rewards**: The NFT’s **base rarity** and **upgrade level** (multiplier) affect how much it earns.
3. **Merge System**: Combine two NFTs of the same rarity to create a **higher-rarity NFT**, improving your rewards.
4. **Optional Locking**: For even higher yields, lock your NFT.

#### What is the Merge System?

If you have **two NFTs of the same rarity**, you can merge them into a single **higher-rarity NFT**. Higher rarity generally means a better **multiplier** and more rewards.

#### How do I sell my XDC NFT?

List or auction your **XDC NFT** on [PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz). When a buyer purchases it, they also gain **ownership** of all staked $pstXDC and any reward multipliers or locked status.

### XDC Liquid Staking (Standard)

#### How does standard Liquid Staking work?

1. **Stake XDC** through the Liquid Staking contract.
2. You receive **$pstXDC** at a **1:1** ratio.
3. **Earn Rewards** continuously while retaining the ability to use $pstXDC freely in DeFi.
4. **Unstake** by burning $pstXDC and waiting the required time to get your XDC back.

#### Who can participate?

**Anyone** can stake in XDC Liquid Staking. There are **no minimums**, making it accessible to all XDC holders.

#### How do I withdraw my staked XDC?

Simply **burn** the equivalent amount of $pstXDC, and your original XDC will be released back to your wallet after the standard unstaking period (1–32 days).

#### Can I transfer my Liquid Staking contract?

Because standard Liquid Staking doesn’t involve an NFT, you can effectively transfer your position by sending $pstXDC to another address. Whoever holds $pstXDC is entitled to the associated rewards.

### XDC Masternode Staking

#### What is XDC Masternode Staking?

**XDC Masternode Staking** is for large XDC holders (generally **10M+ XDC**) who wish to stake in a **full masternode** environment. This typically offers higher or more stable rewards.

#### What are the benefits of Masternode Staking?

* **Enhanced Rewards**: Higher APY compared to standard staking.
* **No Technical Setup**: The masternode is managed by the protocol, removing the burden of hosting and maintenance.
* **Scalable Participation**: Ideal for large-scale holders looking to maximize returns.

#### Can I unstake from XDC Masternode Staking?

Yes. However, unstaking from a masternode may involve a **cooldown period**. Once complete, you burn $pstXDC to retrieve your XDC.

#### Can I transfer my Masternode position?

Yes. You can **transfer** or **sell** your masternode staking contract on [PrimePort.xyz](https://primeport.xyz), granting the new owner full masternode rights and rewards.
