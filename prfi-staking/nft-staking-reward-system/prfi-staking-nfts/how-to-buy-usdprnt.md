# How to Buy $PRNT?

## <mark style="color:purple;">Steps to Acquire PRNT, the Utility Token of Prime Numbers Ecosystem</mark>

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 1 — Choose Your Exchange</mark>

PRNT, the native token of the Prime Numbers ecosystem, can be purchased on both decentralised exchanges (DEXs) and centralised exchanges (CEXs). For beginners, using a CEX is recommended. Start by checking if any exchanges you are signed up with offer PRNT. To do this, visit platforms like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, search for PRNT, and then navigate to the Exchanges tab to see where PRNT is listed.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 2 — Sign Up and Fund Your Account</mark>

If you’re already signed up on a CEX that lists PRNT, simply deposit funds into your account. If not, create an account on one of the recommended exchanges, complete any necessary verification steps, and transfer funds to your exchange account.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 3 — Purchase PRNT</mark>

After funding your account, search for PRNT on the exchange. Select your trading pair, typically PRNT/USDT, and choose your buying method:

* **Limit Order:** Set a specific price at which you want to buy PRNT.
* **Market Buy:** Purchase PRNT instantly at the current market price.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 4 — Transfer PRNT to Your Wallet</mark>

Once your purchase is complete, transfer your PRNT tokens to your personal wallet for safekeeping or for use within the Prime Numbers ecosystem.
