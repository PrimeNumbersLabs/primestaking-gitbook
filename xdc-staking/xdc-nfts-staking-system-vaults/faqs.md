### General Questions

#### What is XDC Liquid Staking?

**XDC Liquid Staking** enables you to stake $XDC **while retaining full liquidity**. Instead of locking up your tokens, you receive $pstXDC (Prime Staked XDC)—a liquid staking derivative that can be freely used or traded in DeFi.

* **XDC NFTs:** Stake $pstXDC inside XDC NFTs to earn masternode rewards plus additional bonuses from the PrimeFi ecosystem.
* **XDC Liquid Staking (Standard):** A straightforward way to stake XDC and receive $pstXDC—no minimum required.
* **XDC Masternode Staking:** For large holders (10M+ XDC), stake in a masternode setting for enhanced yields.

#### What is $pstXDC?

$pstXDC represents your staked XDC in liquid form. Holding $pstXDC means you **continue to earn staking rewards (paid in XDC) even as you use or trade it**.

#### Where can I trade $pstXDC?

You can trade $pstXDC on various **DEXs**, typically paired with $XDC. Purchasing $pstXDC directly also grants you rewards, since holding it is effectively holding a staked position.

#### What happens when I unstake?

When you decide to unstake your XDC, you **burn the corresponding $pstXDC**. This process redeems your original XDC. After any required waiting period (usually **1–32 days**), the XDC returns to your wallet.

#### Can I transfer my staking position?

Yes!

* **XDC NFTs:** If your staked $pstXDC is inside an XDC NFT, you can sell or transfer it—typically via PrimePort.xyz.
* **XDC Masternode Staking:** If you have a masternode stake, you can transfer ownership of the staking contract (and the associated $pstXDC) to a new owner.

#### How does the team distribute rewards?

The team sends rewards (paid in XDC) to a smart contract that allocates them proportionally to $pstXDC holders or to XDC NFTs staked with $pstXDC. You receive your share upon claiming.

### XDC NFTs

#### What are XDC Staking NFTs?

**XDC Staking NFTs** offer a gamified approach to staking. You deposit $pstXDC into an NFT, which has a rarity and level that **determines your staking multiplier and boosts rewards**.

#### How do XDC NFTs work?

1. **Stake $pstXDC:** Acquire $pstXDC (by staking XDC or buying on a DEX) and deposit it into your NFT.
2. **NFT Rewards:** The NFT’s base rarity and upgrade level (multiplier) affect how much it earns.
3. **Merge System:** Combine two NFTs of the same rarity to create a higher-rarity NFT, improving your rewards.
4. **Optional Locking:** Lock your NFT for even higher yields.

#### What is the Merge System?

If you have two NFTs of the same rarity, you can **merge** them into a single higher-rarity NFT. Higher rarity generally means a **better multiplier and more rewards**.

#### How do I sell my XDC NFT?

List or auction your XDC NFT on **PrimePort.xyz**. When purchased, the buyer gains ownership of all staked $pstXDC and any reward multipliers or locked status the NFT carries.

### XDC Liquid Staking (Standard)

#### How does standard Liquid Staking work?

1. **Stake XDC** through the Liquid Staking contract.
2. **Receive $pstXDC** at a 1:1 ratio.
3. **Earn Rewards** continuously, while retaining the freedom to use $pstXDC in DeFi.
4. **Unstake** by burning $pstXDC and waiting the required time (1–32 days) to get your XDC back.

#### Who can participate?

Anyone can stake in XDC Liquid Staking—**no minimum XDC required.** It’s accessible to all XDC holders.

#### How do I withdraw my staked XDC?

Simply **burn the equivalent amount of $pstXDC**, and your original XDC will be released back to your wallet after the **standard unstaking period (1–32 days).**

#### Can I transfer my Liquid Staking contract?

Standard Liquid Staking doesn’t involve an NFT. You can effectively transfer your position by **sending $pstXDC to another address**—whoever holds $pstXDC is entitled to the associated rewards.

### XDC Masternode Staking

#### What is XDC Masternode Staking?

**XDC Masternode Staking** is designed for large XDC holders (generally **10M+ XDC**). You stake your XDC in a full masternode environment, which often provides **higher or more stable rewards**.

#### What are the benefits of Masternode Staking?

* **Enhanced Rewards:** Typically offers a higher APY than standard staking.
* **No Technical Setup:** The protocol manages the masternode, removing the burden of hosting and maintenance.
* **Scalable Participation:** Ideal for large-scale holders seeking to maximize returns.

#### Can I unstake from XDC Masternode Staking?

Yes. **Unstaking** may involve a cooldown period. Once complete, you burn $pstXDC to retrieve your XDC.

#### Can I transfer my Masternode position?

Yes. You can transfer or sell your **masternode staking contract** on PrimePort.xyz, giving the new owner full masternode rights and rewards.
