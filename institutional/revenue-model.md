# Revenue Model

PrimeStaking generates revenue from staking operations on the XDC Network. Partners participate in this revenue through transparent, on-chain mechanisms.

## How Revenue Is Generated

PrimeStaking's revenue comes from a protocol fee applied to staking rewards generated by XDC Network validators. The user-facing APY (~4.5%) is net of this fee.

| Parameter | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Revenue source** | Protocol fee on validator staking rewards |
| **Applied to** | XDC Liquid Staking |
| **Transparency** | On-chain, auditable |
| **User-facing APY** | ~4.5% (net of protocol fee) |

## Revenue Sharing

Partners earn a share of the protocol fees generated through their integration. Revenue share terms are negotiated as part of the partnership agreement and depend on:

- Expected TVL contribution
- Integration model (White Label vs. Powered by Prime)
- Operational and support commitments

## Settlement & Reporting

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Settlement frequency** | Monthly |
| **Data source** | On-chain events (staking, rewards, withdrawals) |
| **Reconciliation** | Automated reporting with transaction-level detail |
| **Proof of reserves** | On-chain verifiable at any time |

Partners receive monthly settlement reports covering TVL, gross rewards, protocol fees, partner revenue share, and net user distributions.

## Revenue Sustainability

PrimeStaking's revenue model is tied to real validator economics on the XDC Network:

- **Validator rewards** are generated by the XDC Network consensus mechanism
- **No token emissions** are required to sustain yield - rewards come from network staking
- **Protocol fees** are a percentage of actual rewards, not inflationary tokenomics
- **Scalable** - revenue grows linearly with TVL without additional infrastructure cost per user
