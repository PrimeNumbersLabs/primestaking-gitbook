# XDC Liquid Staking System

The XDC Liquid Staking System is the one‑and‑only way to stake XDC—offering a simple, accessible path for all XDC holders to earn masternode rewards, similar to Lido Finance. There are no high capital requirements, KYC barriers, or hosting costs.

## How It Works

**Stake and Receive $psXDC (Prime Staked XDC)**\
When you stake your XDC, you receive an equal amount of **$psXDC** at a 1 : 1 ratio.\
&#xNAN;**$psXDC** represents your staked XDC and remains fully liquid—you can trade it or use it in other DeFi applications.

**Earn Rewards by Holding $psXDC**\
Because **$psXDC** is directly tied to your staked XDC, simply holding **$psXDC** entitles you to masternode rewards, which are paid in XDC.\
If you buy **$psXDC** from a DEX, you start receiving rewards right away—no separate staking action is required.

**Use XDC NFTs for Additional Staking**\
You can further stake your **$psXDC** inside XDC NFTs, which also pay rewards in XDC.\
This allows you to earn extra rewards, whether you hold **$psXDC** directly or within these NFTs.

**Flexible Redemption**\
To unstake, you can return your **$psXDC** for XDC on a 1 : 1 basis, usually taking 1–32 days.\
This ensures you retain liquidity while your original tokens are earning rewards.

#### Key Features and Benefits

* **Access Masternode Rewards**\

* **Liquidity with $psXDC**\
  &#xNAN;**$psXDC** can be used across various DeFi services or traded freely, all while accumulating rewards paid in XDC.

#### Security and Transparency

* **Smart Contract‑Driven**\
  All staking operations run on secure, audited smart contracts.
* **Decentralized Reward Distribution**\
  Masternode rewards (paid in XDC) are distributed proportionally and transparently, ensuring fair returns for everyone holding **$psXDC**.
