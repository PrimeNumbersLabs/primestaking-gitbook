# SLA & Support

PrimeStaking provides differentiated support and uptime commitments based on the partner's integration model.

---

## Uptime SLA

| Component | Target | Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Smart contracts** | 99.9% | On-chain availability (dependent on XDC Network uptime) |
| **Validator operations** | 99.5% | Validator uptime and reward generation |
| **API / SDK** | 99.5% | Availability of off-chain integration endpoints |
| **Frontend (Powered by Prime)** | 99.0% | Widget / embedded UI availability |

Uptime is measured monthly. Downtime due to XDC Network-level issues is excluded from SLA calculations.

## Incident Response

| Severity | Response Time | Resolution Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** (fund loss risk, contract exploit) | < 1 hour | Pause + patch within 24 hours |
| **High** (degraded service, delayed rewards) | < 4 hours | Resolution within 48 hours |
| **Medium** (non-critical bug, UI issue) | < 24 hours | Resolution within 72 hours |
| **Low** (cosmetic, documentation) | < 48 hours | Next scheduled release |
