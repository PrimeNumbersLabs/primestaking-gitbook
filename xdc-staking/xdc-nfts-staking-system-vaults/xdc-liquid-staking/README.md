## How It Works

### 1. Stake

Deposit XDC through the staking interface at [primestaking.xyz](https://primestaking.xyz/xdc-liquid-staking/overview). No account setup or KYC required — just connect your wallet.

### 2. Receive psXDC

You receive psXDC at a 1:1 ratio, instantly confirmed on-chain. psXDC is your proof of staked ownership.

### 3. Earn Rewards

Rewards accrue continuously at ~4.5% APY. Your staked XDC is allocated to validators on the XDC Network, and the generated rewards are distributed proportionally to all psXDC holders.

Claim your rewards from the **Rewards** tab in the app whenever you want.

### 4. Use psXDC

psXDC is a standard token on the XDC Network. While your XDC earns rewards in the background, you can:

- **Hold** psXDC to accumulate rewards passively.
- **Trade** psXDC on DEXs (typically paired with XDC).
- **Stake inside XDC NFTs** to boost your APY up to 6%.
- **Transfer** psXDC to any wallet — the recipient starts earning rewards automatically.

### 5. Withdraw

To convert back to XDC, submit a withdrawal request. You burn the corresponding psXDC, and your original XDC is returned after processing through the validator queue (~31 days average).
