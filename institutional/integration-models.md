# Integration Models

PrimeStaking offers two integration models for exchanges, custodians, and institutional partners. Both leverage the same audited, battle-tested infrastructure.

## Model A - White Label

**Your brand. Our infrastructure.**

The partner operates XDC staking under their own brand, powered by PrimeStaking's architecture. End users interact with the partner's interface and never see PrimeStaking branding.

| **Reporting** | Settlement reconciliation data, on-chain proof of reserves |

### Partner Responsibilities

### Commercial Terms

## Model B - Powered by Prime

**Co-branded integration. Minimal technical lift.**

The partner integrates PrimeStaking with visible "Powered by PrimeStaking" branding. This model requires significantly less development effort.

### What We Provide

| **Managed infrastructure** | Same validator operations, reward distribution, and withdrawal processing |
| **Standard reporting** | On-chain transaction data and reward summaries |
