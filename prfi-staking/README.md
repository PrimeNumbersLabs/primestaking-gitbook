# PRFI Staking Overview

PRFI Staking allows holders of PRFI tokens to earn rewards by depositing PRFI into collectible NFTs. Each NFT has a rarity tier and level that determines its share of the monthly reward pool.

## How It Works

1. **Get a PRFI NFT** — Purchase one on [PrimePort](https://primeport.xyz) or through a supported marketplace.
2. **Stake PRFI** — Deposit PRFI tokens into your NFT. This levels up the NFT and increases its reward multiplier.
3. **Earn rewards** — Monthly PRFI distributions are allocated based on your NFT's total multiplier (rarity + level).
4. **Merge** — Combine two same-rarity NFTs into a higher-rarity NFT with stronger multipliers.
5. **Claim** — Claim your PRFI rewards at the end of each month.
