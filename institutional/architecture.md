# Architecture Overview

PrimeStaking V3 runs entirely on audited, on-chain smart contracts deployed on the XDC Network. The architecture is split into two non-upgradeable cores (the psXDC vault and the migration bridge) plus an upgradeable NFT-staking layer with namespaced storage.

Infrastructure is developed in collaboration with **Nethermind** (smart contract engineering and security) and the **XDC Core team** (network-level validator integration).

| `XdcNftBoostHarvester` | Funds the NFT vault's boost accumulator via `notifyBoost`. Only holder of `FEE_ROUTER_ROLE`. | **None** | [`0x3bEd…8DeA`](https://xdcscan.com/address/0x3bEdb37FC873F64BEeFCA551b3A836e59fc18DeA) |

## Validator Infrastructure

PrimeStaking operates XDC Network masternodes that generate the underlying staking yield:

- **Validator delegation** is performed by `PrimeStakedXDC_V3` directly against the on-chain XDC validator contract. No off-chain custodian.
- **Operator onboarding** is admin-controlled (KYC-verified masternode operators); operator scans are bounded by `operatorScanLimit` to prevent gas-griefing.
- **Auto-propose** runs opportunistically during stake or via `triggerAutoPropose(maxNodes)`. It is **blocked whenever the withdrawal queue has a backlog** — user redemptions are prioritised over new validator locks.
- **Resignation** returns principal to the vault after the network `candidateWithdrawDelay` (~35 days under typical block times). `reportMasternodeResignPrincipal(operator)` accounts for the returned principal without inflating the reward share.
- **Per-operator tracking** of outstanding principal both globally and per operator (`outstandingValidatorPrincipalByOperator`).
- **No principal-stake slashing** — XDC penalizes underperforming masternodes via temporary exclusion (~2h) and missed rewards, but never burns staked capital.

## Security Layers

| Layer | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Smart contract audits** | QuillAudits (98.8% on liquid staking) + Nethermind Security (custody / V3 surface) |
| **Permissionless custody** | Validator keys and treasury secured by on-chain contracts |
| **On-chain transparency** | Every stake, queued withdrawal, claim, boost notification, migration, and loss report emits a public event |
| **Non-upgradeable cores** | `PrimeStakedXDC_V3`, migration bridge, NFT collection, migrator, harvester, and bypass facet are all deployed with regular constructors |
| **Controlled NFT vault upgrades** | Only `XdcNftStakingVault` is upgradeable, via TransparentUpgradeableProxy controlled by the protocol multisig; storage is ERC-7201 namespaced to remain collision-proof |
| **Reentrancy protection** | OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` on every state-changing function |
| **Pausable surfaces** | Vault, migrator, and harvester each expose `pause()`/`unpause()` under `PAUSER_ROLE` |
| **Delayed governance** | Every sensitive parameter change (role rotations, loss caps, governance delay itself, ownership transfer) is a schedule → wait → execute flow |
| **Loss caps** | `reportValidatorLoss` is bounded by `maxLossBpsPerReport` and `maxDailyLossBps`, both governed via delayed changes |

## Data Flow

### Staking

1. User calls `stake()` or `depositNative(assets, receiver)` on `PrimeStakedXDC_V3` with native XDC as `msg.value`.
2. Vault mints psXDC shares at the current exchange rate (`totalAssets / totalShares`).
3. Excess liquidity above the buffer triggers auto-propose if no queue backlog exists; XDC is delegated to a masternode through the XDC validator contract.

### Reward Accrual

1. Validator rewards flow back into the vault.
2. `totalAssets` increases; share supply does not.
3. Exchange rate rises automatically — every psXDC share is worth more XDC. There is no manual `claim` step for the base layer.

### Withdrawal

1. User calls `redeemWithQueue(shares, receiver)` (or `withdrawWithQueue(assets, ...)`).
2. If `maxRedeem(user) >= shares`, the redemption settles **instantly** in the same transaction.
3. Otherwise the request enters the FIFO queue; shares are escrowed inside the vault. Settlement uses the live exchange rate at processing time.
4. `processWithdrawalQueue(maxRequests)` is permissionless — anyone can push the queue forward.
5. Failed receiver payouts defer into `pendingQueuedAssets`; the user claims later via `claimQueuedAssets`.

### Boost (NFT layer)

1. Treasury / harvester pushes XDC into `XdcNftStakingVault.notifyBoost(amount)`.
2. The vault converts XDC to psXDC v3 shares and increments `rewardPerWeightStored`.
3. Each staked NFT's pending boost grows proportionally to its weight (`stakedShares × (rarityMultiplier + level + lockBonus)`).
4. NFT holder calls `claim(tokenId, unwrap)` from the app to settle their slice in XDC or shares.

### V2 → V3 Migration

1. **psXDC**: user approves the bridge, calls `migrate(amount, minSharesOut)`. Bridge burns V2 → vault mints V3 shares while migration window is open.
2. **NFTs**: user approves the migrator, calls `migrate(tokenId, minSharesOut)`. Migrator pulls legacy NFT → claims pending V2 rewards (best-effort) → calls `migratorPrepareForBurn` on the legacy Diamond if locked → `burnAndRedeem` on the legacy façade → bridges redeemed psXDC into V3 shares → `mintAndStake[Locked]` on the new vault under the same `tokenId`.

## Integration Points

| Integration Level | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | Embed PrimeStaking widgets or build a custom frontend on top of the contracts | White-label web integration |
| **Smart Contract** | Call `PrimeStakedXDC_V3` directly for stake/withdraw, or `migrate` on the bridge. ERC-4626 standard means partner contracts can wrap psXDC as collateral. | Backend / API integration |
| **Data / Reporting** | On-chain event indexing via [`staking-v3-indexer`](https://github.com/PrimeNumbersLabs/staking-v3-indexer) and [`xdc-nft-v3-indexer`](https://github.com/PrimeNumbersLabs/xdc-nft-v3-indexer) for portfolio and settlement reporting | Compliance and reconciliation |
