# XDC Liquid Staking

The XDC Liquid Staking system provides a secure, efficient way to stake your **$XDC** tokens and receive a liquid staking derivative called **$psXDC (Prime Staked XDC)**. It removes traditional barriers, such as high capital requirements, KYC, and hosting expenses, so all XDC holders can earn masternode rewards (paid in XDC) while retaining liquidity.

***

### What Is XDC Liquid Staking?

**XDC Liquid Staking** is governed by on-chain smart contracts. When you deposit **$XDC**, you automatically receive **$psXDC** at a 1:1 ratio, representing your staked tokens. Because **$psXDC** remains fully liquid, you can trade, transfer, or leverage it in DeFi, all while your underlying **$XDC** continues to generate staking rewards paid in XDC.

### Key Features

#### Staking Interface

* **Streamlined Access**: A simple platform lets you deposit **$XDC** for staking.
* **Instant Derivative Issuance**: Upon confirmation, you immediately receive an equal amount of **$psXDC**.

#### $psXDC (Prime Staked XDC)

* **1:1 Ratio**: For every 1 **$XDC** staked, you receive 1 **$psXDC**.
* **Proof of Staked Ownership**: Holding **$psXDC** reflects your share of staked XDC (and your share of the rewards).
* **DeFi-Ready**: **$psXDC** can be traded, lent, or used in liquidity pools.

#### Rewards Accrual

* **Masternode Participation**: Your staked XDC is allocated to masternodes, which earn rewards regularly.
* **Periodic Payouts**: Rewards accrue automatically and are reflected in the protocol’s total staked balance.

#### Liquidity Through $psXDC

* **Immediate Utility**: **$psXDC** is liquid, allowing you to move in and out of DeFi positions seamlessly.
* **XDC NFTs for Extra Staking**: You can additionally stake **$psXDC** into XDC NFTs for extra rewards, also paid in XDC.

#### Flexible Exit

* **Unstake at a 1:1 Ratio**: When redeeming, return **$psXDC** to get your original XDC plus any accrued rewards.
* **1–32 Day Redemption**: Typically, it takes 1–32 days to fully unstake. Until then, you’re free to hold, trade, or transfer your **$psXDC**.

### Guide for Claiming Rewards

#### Monthly Reward Distribution

* **Timing**: The protocol generally allocates rewards on the last day of each month (or at another set interval).
* **Proportional Payout**: Rewards go to every address holding **$psXDC** at distribution time, calculated proportionally to the amount of **$psXDC** held.
* **No Full Stake Requirement**: You do not need to keep your entire original stake; partial ownership of **$psXDC** still earns you a proportional share of rewards.
