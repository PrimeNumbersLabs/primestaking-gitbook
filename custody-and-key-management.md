# Custody & Key Management

PrimeStaking is transitioning to a fully **permissionless and trustless** validator custody model powered by on-chain smart contracts - eliminating human interaction from custody flows entirely.

---

## The New Model

The custody upgrade introduces:

- **Smart contract-based execution** - validator keys and staked XDC are managed entirely by audited smart contracts, with no human interaction in custody flows.
- **Permissionless** - anyone can verify the state of validators and staked assets on-chain. No centralized approval required.
- **Trustless** - no single entity controls the keys. The protocol enforces custody rules through code, not operational trust.
- **Institutional-grade transparency** - increased operational transparency aligned with institutional security standards.

---

## Audit & Collaboration

A full security audit of the custody contracts is currently in progress.

PrimeStaking is collaborating with:

- **XDC Core team**
- **Nethermind**

The goal: build a **100% permissionless, institution-ready** staking infrastructure.

## What This Means for Users

| Property | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Custody model** | Smart contract-based (no third-party custodian) |
| **Key management** | Validator keys secured by on-chain contracts |
| **Human interaction** | Eliminated from custody flows |
| **Verifiability** | Fully transparent and auditable on the blockchain |
| **User action required** | None - the transition is seamless |

---

## Timeline

1. **Smart contract audit** - In progress with independent auditors.
2. **Deployment** - Within weeks of audit completion, the contract-based custody will go live.
3. **Full decentralization** - Once deployed, validator custody becomes fully permissionless and trustless.

---

## Impact on Users

- **No change** to reward rates, withdrawal times, or fee structure.
- Users retain **full ownership** of their assets at all times.
- The move to contract-based custody eliminates reliance on any centralized custodian, strengthening the protocol's decentralization.
