# XDC Liquid Staking

The **XDC Liquid Staking** system provides a secure, efficient way to stake your $XDC tokens and receive a liquid staking derivative called **$pstXDC** (Prime Staked XDC). It removes traditional barriers—such as high capital requirements, KYC, and hosting expenses—so all XDC holders can earn masternode rewards while retaining liquidity.

***

### What Is XDC Liquid Staking?

**XDC Liquid Staking** is governed by on-chain smart contracts. When you deposit $XDC, you automatically receive **$pstXDC** at a **1:1 ratio**, representing your staked tokens. Because $pstXDC remains fully liquid, you can trade, transfer, or leverage it in DeFi—all while your underlying $XDC continues to generate staking rewards.

### Key Features

1. **Staking Interface**
   * **Streamlined Access:** A simple platform lets you deposit $XDC for staking.
   * **Instant Derivative Issuance:** Upon confirmation, you immediately receive an equal amount of $pstXDC.
2. **$pstXDC (Prime Staked XDC)**
   * **1:1 Ratio:** For every 1 $XDC staked, you receive 1 $pstXDC.
   * **Proof of Staked Ownership:** Holding $pstXDC reflects your share of staked XDC (and your share of the rewards).
   * **DeFi-Ready:** $pstXDC can be traded, lent, or used in liquidity pools.
3. **Rewards Accrual**
   * **Masternode Participation:** Your staked XDC is allocated to masternodes, which earn rewards regularly.
   * **Periodic Payouts:** Rewards accrue automatically and are reflected in the protocol’s total staked balance.
4. **Liquidity Through $pstXDC**
   * **Immediate Utility:** $pstXDC is liquid, allowing you to move in and out of DeFi positions seamlessly.
   * **XDC NFTs for Extra Staking:** You can additionally stake $pstXDC into **XDC NFTs** for extra rewards—also paid in $pstXDC.
5. **Flexible Exit**
   * **Unstake at a 1:1 Ratio:** When redeeming, return $pstXDC to get your original XDC plus any accrued rewards.
   * **1–32 Day Redemption:** Typically, it takes 1–32 days to fully unstake. Until then, you’re free to hold, trade, or transfer your $pstXDC.

### Guide for Claiming Rewards

#### Monthly Reward Distribution

* **Timing:** The protocol generally allocates rewards on the last day of each month (or at another set interval).
* **Proportional Payout:** **Rewards go to every address holding $pstXDC at distribution time**, calculated proportionally to the amount of $pstXDC held.
* **No Full Stake Requirement:** You do **not** need to keep your entire original stake; partial ownership of $pstXDC still earns you a proportional share of rewards.

### How to Use XDC Liquid Staking

1. **Get $pstXDC**
   * **From the Staking Platform:** Deposit XDC on the official staking interface to mint $pstXDC.
   * **From a DEX:** Purchase $pstXDC directly on a decentralized exchange—once you hold it, you start earning rewards.
2. **Start Staking (Platform Method)**
   * Access the **XDC Staking** platform and choose the option to begin staking.
   * Confirm the on-chain contract creation.
3. **Deposit $XDC**
   * Decide how much XDC to stake and deposit via the platform interface.
   * Complete the on-chain deposit transaction.
4. **Receive $pstXDC**
   * Once confirmed, you automatically receive a matching amount of $pstXDC (1:1).
   * You can now use $pstXDC in any DeFi application while earning masternode rewards in the background.
5. **Manage Rewards and Unstaking**
   * **Rewards Tracking:** Monitor your $pstXDC balance to see accrued rewards over time.
   * **Unstake:** When you wish to convert back to XDC, burn your $pstXDC to redeem your original tokens plus accrued rewards (1–32 days typical processing).
