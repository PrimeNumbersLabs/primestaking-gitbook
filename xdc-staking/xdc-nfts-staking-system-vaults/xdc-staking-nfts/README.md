### <mark style="color:purple;">Handmade Prime Numbers NFTs</mark>

The collection includes 15 exclusive, handcrafted NFTs by our Art Director. Owners of these rare NFTs receive three additional XDC Staking NFTs, enhancing their staking capabilities. These NFTs are artistically valuable and come with a **base multiplier of 2**, making them highly sought after for their increased earning potential.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Generative XDC Staking NFTs</mark>

The 5,542 generative NFTs are designed with different rarity levels, each offering a distinct base multiplier that determines the rewards you can earn:

\#1 Plentiful: Base Multiplier: 0.3

\#2 Common: Base Multiplier: 0.4

\#3 Uncommon: Base Multiplier: 0.5

\#4 Rare: Base Multiplier: 0.7

\#5 Epic: Base Multiplier: 0.9

\#6 Legendary: Base Multiplier: 1.2

\#7 Mythic: Base Multiplier: 1.5

\#8 Godly: Base Multiplier: 1.9

These varying levels of rarity ensure that each NFT is unique and valuable, providing both collectors and investors with a range of options to suit their staking strategy.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Merge System</mark>

We are happy to show you how our NFT merge system works.

**You can merge two NFTs of the same rarity to get one of the following rarities.**

Examples: Merging two **common NFTs** will make **one uncommon NFT.** The merge of **2 mythic NFTs** will make **one godly NFT.**

**Godly** is the highest rarity you can get through the **merge system**.

When you merge 2 NFTs, they are burned and you receive 1 NFT of the next rarity.

This mechanism makes the NFTs deflationary.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Refund System (Not Live)</mark>

**You can use the "BurnToRedeem" button to get 300 $PRFI (Refund System)**

This button breaks the NFT and extracts all the $pstXDC inside the NFT. It cannot be reversed; it will burn your NFT and send all the $psXDC to your wallet. Also, you get 300 $PRFI when you break the NFT.

This mechanism makes the NFTs deflationary.\
