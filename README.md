# Overview

PrimeStaking, developed by Prime Numbers Labs, is an advanced derivative staking platform designed to maximize the utility of digital assets. It offers a seamless and efficient way for users to earn rewards by staking their tokens in a secure, user-friendly system. PrimeStaking currently supports two types of staking:

#### 1. **PRFI Staking**

**For PRFI Token Holders**\
**Purpose:** PRFI Staking enables holders of PRFI tokens to earn rewards by staking their tokens within the PrimeStaking system.\
**Rewards:** Stakers earn multiple types of rewards, including but not limited to:

* Additional PRFI tokens
* Participation-based incentives
* Potential benefits from ecosystem growth

**Flexibility:** Designed for those looking to grow their PRFI holdings while actively supporting the PrimeFi ecosystem.

***

#### 2. **XDC Liquid Staking**

**For XDC Token Holders**\
**Purpose:** XDC Staking allows holders of XDC to stake their tokens and earn a variable annual percentage yield (APY).

**Mechanism:**

* Users stake $XDC into the system and receive $pstXDC tokens as a liquid staking derivative.
* $pstXDC tokens represent the staked XDC and can be used in DeFi protocols while still accruing staking rewards.

**Rewards:**

* Generated from masternode operations, ensuring participants benefit from the network's growth without needing to meet high entry requirements like KYC or minimum token holdings.

**Advantages:**

* **Low barriers to entry:** No 10M XDC requirement.
* **Liquidity:** $pstXDC allows flexible asset utilization while earning rewards.

***

#### 3. **XDC NFTs Staking**

**For XDC Token Holders**\
**Purpose:** XDC NFTs combine the power of staking and non-fungible tokens to provide unique staking opportunities and enhanced rewards.

**Mechanism:**

* XDC NFTs act as trustless "vaults" where users can stake their $XDC tokens.
* Each NFT has unique rarity and multipliers, directly impacting the rewards staked within it.

**Features:**

* **Merge System:** Combine NFTs to create higher-rarity assets, increasing rewards and adding deflationary pressure.

**Advantages:**

* Gamified Staking: Engage with staking in a fun, dynamic way through collectible and upgradable NFTs.
* Enhanced Rewards: Higher rarity NFTs yield better staking benefits, creating a strategic layer for holders.
