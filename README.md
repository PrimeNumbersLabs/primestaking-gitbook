#### XDC Liquid Staking

**For XDC Token Holders**\
XDC Liquid Staking provides holders of XDC tokens with multiple staking options, offering enhanced flexibility and rewards through liquid staking derivatives. Users can stake XDC in one of three ways:

1. **XDC NFTs**
   * **Purpose:** The first XDC Staking collection, now integrated with liquid staking capabilities.
   * **Mechanism:**
     * XDC NFTs act as trustless "vaults" where users can stake their $XDC tokens.
     * Each NFT has unique rarity and multipliers, directly impacting staking rewards.
   * **Features:**
     * **Merge System:** Combine NFTs of the same rarity to create higher-rarity assets, increasing rewards and adding deflationary pressure.
   * **Advantages:**
     * Gamified staking through collectible and upgradable NFTs.
     * Higher rarity NFTs yield better staking benefits, creating a strategic layer for holders.
2. **XDC Vaults**
   * **Purpose:** A staking solution designed for everyone, with no minimum requirements.
   * **Mechanism:**
     * Users stake $XDC into the system and receive $pstXDC tokens as a liquid staking derivative.
     * $pstXDC tokens represent the staked XDC and can be used in DeFi protocols while still accruing staking rewards.
   * **Advantages:**
     * Low barriers to entry.
     * Liquidity through $pstXDC for flexible asset utilization while earning rewards.
3. **XDC Masternode Vaults**
   * **Purpose:** Tailored for high-value participants holding 10M XDC or more.
   * **Mechanism:**
     * Allows direct participation in masternode operations with automated reward distributions.
   * **Advantages:**
     * Exclusive rewards derived from masternode operations.
     * Seamless participation without needing to meet technical requirements.
