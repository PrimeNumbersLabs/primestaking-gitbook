# XDC Liquid Staking System

The XDC Liquid Staking System is PrimeStaking's core infrastructure. It enables XDC holders to earn staking rewards without running infrastructure or locking funds permanently.

## How It Works

```
Stake XDC  →  Receive psXDC (1:1)  →  Earn ~4.5% APY  →  Withdraw anytime
```

1. **Deposit XDC** into the liquid staking smart contract.
2. **Receive psXDC** instantly at a 1:1 ratio.
3. **Earn rewards** — your staked XDC generates validator rewards continuously.
4. **Use psXDC** — it's a standard token on the XDC Network. Hold it, trade it, or stake it inside XDC NFTs for boosted yields.
5. **Withdraw** — burn psXDC to get your XDC back. Withdrawals are processed via the validator queue (~31 days average).

## Two Ways to Earn

### XDC Liquid Staking (~4.5% APY)

The simplest path. Stake XDC, receive psXDC, earn rewards. No NFT required, no minimum amount.

### XDC NFTs (Up to 6% APY)

Gamified staking. Deposit psXDC into collectible NFTs. Each NFT has a rarity tier and level that multiplies your rewards. Merge NFTs to upgrade rarity. Lock NFTs for 1 year for an additional 1.25% APY bonus.

## What Is psXDC?

**psXDC (Prime Staked XDC)** is the liquid staking derivative you receive when you stake XDC.

| Property | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Ratio | 1 XDC = 1 psXDC (always) |
| Network | XDC Network |
| Transferable | Yes — send, trade, or use in DeFi |
| Earns rewards | Yes — holding psXDC earns staking rewards |
| Redeemable | Yes — burn psXDC to withdraw XDC |

psXDC is the entry point to the entire staking ecosystem. You can hold it as-is for ~4.5% APY, or deposit it into XDC NFTs for up to 6% APY.
