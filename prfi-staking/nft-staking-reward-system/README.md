# Staking Reward System

## <mark style="color:purple;">Staking Reward System: Transforming Digital Collectibles into Income-Generating Assets</mark>

Prime Numbers Labs introduces a **Token Staking Reward System**, enabling users to stake tokens into NFTs to unlock reward-generating capabilities. This system transforms NFTs into dynamic financial tools by integrating token staking mechanisms that enhance their utility and provide value accrual opportunities.

### <mark style="color:purple;">How It Works: Unlocking the Value of Your NFTs</mark>

The Token Staking Reward System allows users to deposit platform tokens into specific NFTs. This staking process activates reward mechanisms tied to the NFT’s attributes, such as rarity or category, for the duration of the staking period.

* **Staking Mechanism:** Users allocate tokens to selected NFTs. The NFT acts as a staking vehicle, generating rewards proportional to the amount staked, the NFT’s properties, and platform-defined parameters.
* **Dynamic Reward Model:** Rewards are calculated based on factors like the NFT’s rarity tier, staking duration, and overall protocol performance, ensuring that reward distribution remains fair and scalable.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Core Features</mark>

* **Token Allocation to NFTs:** Users can deposit tokens into designated NFTs, linking the value of staked tokens to the NFT’s earning potential.
* **Earning Rewards:** As tokens are staked, rewards accumulate over time, incentivizing long-term participation and active engagement.
* **Dynamic and Fair Distribution:** The system adjusts reward outputs dynamically based on multiple variables, ensuring optimized returns aligned with asset performance.

* **Enhanced NFT Utility:** Token staking transforms NFTs into active financial instruments, adding a layer of functionality beyond mere ownership.
* **Optimized Returns:** A reward system designed to align with staking behaviour ensures returns to scale with staking input and duration.
* **Collateralized Lending:** Staked NFTs retain their collateralization potential, allowing users to leverage their assets without interrupting staking rewards.
* **Secure and Transparent:** Built on blockchain technology, the system ensures transparency in reward distribution and full security for staked assets.
