# Staking Mechanics

Stake PRFI tokens inside your NFT to earn rewards. The NFT's value and earning potential grow as it levels up.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Stake PRFI

Deposit PRFI tokens into your NFT. This increases the NFT's level and activates its reward multiplier.

### 2. Earn Rewards

Your NFT earns from multiple sources:

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **PRFI Rewards Pool** | 100,000 PRFI distributed monthly across all staked NFTs |
| **NFT Royalties** | Share of PrimePort marketplace royalties |
| **PrimeFi Profits** | 40% of PrimeFi protocol profits |

### 3. Level Up

As you stake more PRFI, your NFT progresses through levels (1–20). Each level increases the **added multiplier**, boosting your share of the reward pool.

## Multiplier System

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Base Multiplier** | Set by the NFT's rarity tier (fixed) |
| **Added Multiplier** | Increases as the NFT levels up (1–20) |
| **Total Multiplier** | Base + Added — determines your reward share |

## Interface Actions

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Stake** | Deposit PRFI into the NFT to earn rewards and level up. |
| **Get Surplus** | Withdraw PRFI above 41,490 for free once the NFT reaches max level. |
| **Burn to Redeem** | Destroy the NFT to withdraw all staked PRFI. |
| **Transfer** | Move the NFT to another wallet. |
| **Withdraw PRFI** | Remove PRFI with a 20% fee (redistributed to other holders). |
| **Claim PRFI** | Claim monthly rewards. |
| **Sell** | List or auction the NFT on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/primenumbers-prfi-onft) (Base). |
| **Merge** | Combine two same-rarity NFTs into a higher-rarity NFT. |

## Growth

As your NFT levels up, it earns a progressively larger share of the reward pool. Rewards are available at the end of each month and contribute to the long-term value of your NFT.
