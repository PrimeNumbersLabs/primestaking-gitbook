# XDC Masternode Vaults

XDC Masternode Vaults are specialized staking Vaults designed for users with a minimum of 10 million $XDC tokens who wish to operate an XDC masternode. These Vaults simplify the process of running a masternode, managing rewards, and covering operational expenses, while also providing liquidity through $pstXDC tokens.

#### **What Are XDC Masternode Vaults?**

XDC Masternode Vaults function similarly to standard XDC Vaults but are exclusively for users with 10M $XDC required to mint the Vault. These Vaults allow users to stake $XDC, operate a masternode, and earn **7.65% APY** from the masternode rewards. Additionally, when staking 10M $XDC, users receive **10M $pstXDC** in their wallet, enabling liquidity through liquid staking derivatives.

#### **How It Works**

1. **Mint an XDC Masternode Vault:**
   * Users with 10M $XDC can mint an XDC Masternode Vault, represented as an NFT that manages the staked tokens.
2. **Receive Liquid Staking Tokens:**
   * When you stake 10M $XDC into the Vault, the system automatically mints **10M $pstXDC** and sends it to your wallet.
   * $pstXDC serves as proof of your staked tokens and can be freely used in the ecosystem, such as in DeFi protocols, without affecting your masternode rewards.
3. **Earn Masternode Rewards:**
   * Your staked $XDC generates rewards at **7.65% APY**, distributed proportionally to your Vault balance.
   * The platform retains **0.35% of the 8% APY** to cover hosting and operational fees.
4. **Liquidity Through $pstXDC:**
   * $pstXDC tokens maintain a 1:1 ratio with staked $XDC, allowing users to use their tokens in DeFi applications while still earning masternode rewards.
   * $pstXDC can be traded, staked in other protocols, or redeemed for the underlying $XDC.
5. **Redeem Your $XDC:**
   * To exit, click the **Request Withdraw XDC** button. This resigns the masternode and initiates the withdrawal process.
   * After a **32-day waiting period**, your $XDC, along with any rewards, will be available for redemption.
   * Redeeming $XDC burns the corresponding $pstXDC tokens.

#### **Key Features**

1. **Liquid Staking:**
   * Users receive **10M $pstXDC** for every 10M $XDC staked, providing liquidity and flexibility while maintaining staking rewards.

3. **No Hosting Hassles:**

4. **Effortless Withdrawal Process:**
