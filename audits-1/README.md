# Audits

## Security Audits

All PrimeStaking smart contracts undergo independent external audits before deployment and whenever significant updates are introduced.

---

### Methodology

1. **Reputable external auditor** - We partner with leading firms (e.g., QuillAudits) that review every line of code and validate the economic logic of the contracts.
2. **Two-phase process**
   - *Preliminary report:* Identification of findings.
   - *Fix & Verify:* The engineering team resolves issues and the auditor performs final verification.
3. **Transparent disclosure** - Full reports are published so the community can verify the scope and applied fixes.
